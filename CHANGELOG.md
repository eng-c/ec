## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.15] - 2026-09-06

A value whose type is only known while the program runs now converts to fit, so a mixed list or map value can no longer crash a program.

### Fixed
- **A dynamically-typed value read into a typed variable now casts
  everywhere, not just at a map read.** #114 covered a map-key read only;
  a `value` variable, an element/first/last off a list proven mixed, and
  a call to a `value`-returning function now get the same runtime-tag
  cast, or the error flag on an undefined cast, instead of copying raw
  bits. Closes the whole class of SIGSEGVs and stray pointer prints
  #114's narrower fix left open (#115).
- **A single-quoted one-word name now resolves inside a `{...}` format-string
  slot, exactly as it already did everywhere else.** `Print "{'tally'}"` used
  to fail with "Unknown variable: 'tally'" for every variable type — the slot
  parser fell back to using the placeholder's raw text, quote marks included,
  as the variable name whenever the quoted name had no space in it. A quoted
  name followed by a property (`{'toolbox's size}`) or a multi-word quoted
  name (`{'the toolbox'}`) already worked, since both contain a space and
  were already routed through the real lexer; the fix routes the one-word
  case through the same lexer instead of special-casing it (#110).
- **`Free` on a list now actually releases it, everywhere.** A global list
  was a silent no-op (the codegen branch only looked in the local stack
  frame, never the global mirror); a function-local list's block was
  genuinely released but the variable was left pointing at it, so the
  next read segfaulted. A list now gets the same released-buffer contract
  a buffer already has — empty, every write refused with the error flag,
  a second `Free` a no-op that flags — and, freeing a list also
  recursively frees every nested list or map it holds (#109).
- **A list or map placed inside another list or map is now copied, not
  shared.** A nested collection previously aliased the same block: a
  list-literal element, an `append`ed collection, a map value, and every
  way of reading a nested collection back out (`element N of`, `'s
  first`/`last`, a map value, a `For each` loop variable) all handed
  back the SAME pointer, so mutating one side reached the other, and
  freeing the outer one could dangle a separately-named variable. Every
  one of those sites now copies (GitHub #34, Option 1) (#111).
- **A typed function that falls off its end now hands back a real, usable
  empty value for every declared type, not just four of them.** A
  conditional `Return` nested in a branch that never fires used to leave
  the implicit epilogue holding whatever the last computation left in
  `rax` — safe only for `number`/`float`/`boolean`/`text`/`value`. A
  `list` or `buffer` return dereferenced that stray value and segfaulted;
  a `map` return walked it as a bogus header and hung; a `thing` return
  handed back real, valid storage that was never actually written, so it
  read the caller's leftover stack instead of the type's declared
  defaults. `list`, `map`, `buffer`, `time`, and `thing` now fall off the
  end exactly as the manual already promised for every other type: a
  real empty `[]`/`{}`/buffer that still takes `append`/a key set, the
  zero time, or the thing's all-defaults instance (#112).
- Keywords chapter lists every reserved word, checked by a new
  drift-guard test (#106 second half, GitHub #239).
- **Reading a dynamic map value into a typed variable now casts it to that
  type instead of crashing.** A map built with `Set` (or a literal map
  holding more than one value type) carries a runtime type tag the
  compiler cannot see statically; a `text called t is m's "k".` where
  `"k"` held a number used to copy the number's raw bits into the text
  slot, which segfaulted on first use. It is now cast to the destination
  type exactly as an explicit `... as a text` would (owner ruling); a cast
  the language does not define (a number into a `list`/`map`, or the
  reverse) raises the error flag instead of crashing (#114).
- **Redeclaring a global as a different kind now names the conflict at the redeclaration, not "Unknown variable" at some later read.** `a list called kept is [].` followed later by `a buffer called kept is 16 bytes in size.` used to report `Unknown variable: kept` at the first function that read `kept`, with a misleading hint about if/otherwise branches; the buffer declaration itself raised no error at all. A buffer declaration now runs the same redeclaration check every other typed declaration already gets, and the analyzer no longer reports a read of a name two declarations disagree on as unknown, since the one diagnostic that matters, "'kept' is already declared as a list", now lands on the second declaration, naming both kinds (#123).
- **A number, text, or other plain variable declared in every branch of an
  `if`/`otherwise` is now visible after it, exactly as a file handle
  already was.** A file handle worked because it always registered
  directly as a global declaration; a plain variable instead only counted
  toward a branch's own guard bucket whenever that branch's condition was
  a bare boolean, so the check for "declared on every path" never saw it
  and a later read failed with `used before it is declared`, contradicting
  LANGUAGE.md's "Declarations in Branches" rule. A branch's own guarded
  declarations now also count toward what it definitely declares (#119).
- **A `To`/`Library` definition refused for starting inside an open clause
  now names the specific clause it is still inside, instead of a generic
  list of every clause kind a definition might ever be nested in.** The
  refusal itself dates to #96; the message now says, for example, that
  "a `While` loop is still open here" or "an `Otherwise` branch is still
  open here", naming whichever `If`/`Otherwise` branch, loop, or `On
  error` handler actually applies (#122).
- **A possessive member call now looks past a line break before its
  preposition, exactly as a free call already did.** `origin's 'scaled'`
  followed by a line break then `of 2` used to refuse with "Expected a
  statement, got Of", closing the sentence early even though a single
  line break is cosmetic and only a period or a paragraph break can end
  a clause; the same statement on one line, or a free call across the
  same line break, already compiled. Both possessive-call forms (the
  instance form and the type form, `a <type>'s 'member' <prep> <arg>`)
  now skip a line break before testing for the connector, the same as
  the free-call path; a paragraph break before the preposition still
  force-closes the sentence (#120).
- **A malformed decimal precision in a format slot is now a compile error,
  never a silent no-op.** `{n:.z}` used to render as a bare `{n}`, and a
  width followed by a `.` that named no precision (`{n:8.2z}`, `{n:8.}`)
  fell through the same gap: the leading-dot precision reader, and the one
  for a precision written after a width, both returned without a
  diagnostic whenever what followed the dot was not all digits. Both now
  raise the same unrecognised-specifier error #98 already gives an
  unknown base letter, naming the clause as written and the valid forms
  (#127).

### Added
- `each <name> from <buffer>` walks a buffer's bytes as numbers, `byte`
  allowed as the loop variable (closes the open half of #104).

### Changed
- auto/enable/disable (and their -matic/-d spellings) are no longer
  reserved words — the unimplemented auto-error-catching paths are
  removed (owner ruling).

## [0.4.14] - 2026-08-28

Four register fixes (#102, #105, #106, #108) and the diagnostic halves of two more (#103, #104); a `Free` statement that releases a buffer's memory immediately; the reserved-word tables now generated from one source. 33,000 fuzzer programs on 0.4.13 found no further compiler defects.

### Fixed
- **A call missing its preposition now names the missing preposition.**
  A bare or quoted name written right after a callee with no `of`/`to`/
  `with`/`on` used to be silently split into two statements — the call
  reporting the wrong arity and the name a second, unrelated "Unknown
  function" error. It is now one diagnostic, anchored at the name itself
  (#105).
- **A rejected thing field type no longer also fires a garbled
  default-mismatch error.** The default-vs-type check ran before the
  field-type-support check, and had no arm for an unsupported type, so
  the two slots of "expected X, got Y" rendered the same word. Support
  is decided first now; an unsupported type reports only the "cannot
  hold yet" error (#103).
- **`each ... from` over a non-list anchors its caret at the loop, not
  the collection's declaration.** The diagnostic searched for the
  collection's textually-first mention, which in a large file could be
  hundreds of lines from the offending loop. It now anchors at the
  `each ... from` clause's own use of the collection (#104).
- **`Set <text> to "<format>"` frees the string it replaces instead of
  leaking one buffer per evaluation.** A whole-program gate proves a
  text variable's string is never shared before its `Set` frees the old
  one, so the natural accumulate idiom (`Set acc to "{acc}x"` in a loop)
  is no longer quadratic (#108).
- **`print`'s aliases were reserved unevenly, and the keyword table that decides every other reserved word had drifted from the lexer throughout.** `show`, `display`, and `prints` are live aliases the lexer folds onto `print` and stay reserved; `say` and `output` are not folded at all and stay ordinary variable names — no shipped program's behaviour changes. The alias fold now lives in exactly one place, a `RESERVED_ALIASES` const in `src/lexer/tokens.rs`, which `string_is_keyword` reads from and LANGUAGE.md's Reserved Aliases table (now 85 rows, generated from and checked against the same const) is generated from, so the two tables cannot drift apart again the way they did here (#106; closes #238).
### Added
- `Free`/`Release`/`Deallocate <buffer>` releases a buffer's memory
  immediately; the buffer is then empty and refuses writes with the error
  flag (documented under Releasing a Buffer).

## [0.4.13] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- **The coreasm runtime is modular, and programs pull only what they
  use.** The resource monolith is now four focused modules (fd tracking,
  buffer lifecycle, line reading, render sink); process control lives in
  its own `proc.asm`; a bare `Print` no longer carries the string
  helpers. Binaries shrink accordingly: hello world drops 832 bytes,
  `file_secure.vox` 3,192 — with byte-identical output.
- **Codegen speaks in named macros.** Twenty-two coreasm macros replace
  ~120 inline instruction sequences (`SET_LAST_ERROR`,
  `BUFFER_DATA_ADDR`, `BOOL_FROM_RAX`, the `INT_IS_` family and
  friends), and the dead 16-byte `BUFFER_DATA_PTR` trap is deleted —
  the emitted behavior is unchanged, the x86_64 knowledge now lives in
  one place per idea.
- **The examples tell only the present truth.** Six stale comment
  claims rewritten — two had outlived the features they called proposed,
  one printed a float caveat its own output disproved.

### Fixed
- **A freshly built compiler now uses its own coreasm.** The runtime
  search prefers the tree next to the executable over an installed
  `/usr/share/vox/coreasm`, so a development build can no longer
  silently assemble against an older release's runtime (#233).

## [0.4.12] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- **Generated assembly identifies its maker.** The banner comment at the top
  of every emitted `.asm` file now reads `; Generated by vox <version>`
  instead of the historical `; Generated by ec`.
- **The packaging spec builds vendored on Amazon Linux.** AL2023 defines
  `%{fedora}` yet ships neither `cargo-rpm-macros` nor the packaged rust
  crates, so the unbundled path's condition becomes
  `%if 0%{?fedora} && !0%{?amzn}`; Fedora chroots are unaffected.
- **The manual names the words that open a consuming clause.** Basics gains
  the list (`If`/`Otherwise`, `While`, `For each`, `Repeat`, `On error`,
  `but if`) and documents period-stacking to close more than one open
  clause at once.
- **The `examples/` set is curated for the site.** Six dev-scratch files
  (`test_simple.vox`, `exit_test.vox`, `func_test.vox`, `file_test.vox`,
  `file_simple.vox`, `count.vox`) that were never showcase material are
  removed, and `loop_expansion_test.vox` becomes `expansion.vox`, a real
  demonstration of a single `each` expansion, a chained two-`each` grid, and
  a `but if` branch inside an expansion.

### Fixed
- **A bare or relative `.lib` name in `see` now resolves against an installed library's interface.** The search order for a `.lib` gains `/usr/include/vox` as its final step — after the containing file's directory and every `--lib-path` — so `see json version "0.1" from "json.lib".` finds an installed library with no flag needed, while a development `.lib` beside the source or on `--lib-path` still shadows the installed one of the same name. The "Paths tried" diagnostic on a miss now names the system directory too, and the emitted `RUNPATH` no longer copies every `--lib-path` directory verbatim — only directories a `see`d `.so` actually resolved from land on it (#99).
- **A zero-width format specifier, `{n:0}` or `{n:00000}`, compiled as an
  unknown-specifier error.** A width of 0 pads nothing — the manual's width
  row carries no floor on `N`, and 0.4.10 already treated it as a no-op —
  but the #98 fix that refused an unrecognised clause caught a clause of
  nothing but zeros along with it, since stripping every leading zero for
  the width left no digits behind either way. A bare `0` or `00...0` is now
  read as its own case, a width of zero, rather than falling through to the
  catch-all (#100).

## [0.4.11] - 2026-08-23

### Changed
- **LANGUAGE.md carries no em dashes.** The house rule for public copy now applies to the specification: every em dash is rewritten as ordinary punctuation, no sentence changed, and one heading reads “Chained `each` clauses: a grid”.
- A `To` (function definition) or `Library` declaration reached while an `If`, a loop, or another definition's body is still open is now a compile error naming the construct and saying to move it above the block, instead of being silently parsed into that body and shifting the control flow of every statement written after it (#96).
- **Packaging: `vox.spec` passes `fedora-review`.** The spec now builds two
  ways from one file: unbundled on Fedora, against the packaged
  `rust-*-devel` crates with the cargo RPM macros, and vendored everywhere
  else (EPEL, CentOS Stream, openSUSE, Mageia, Amazon Linux, openEuler,
  Azure Linux, ELN) with every bundled crate declared. It gained a `%check`
  that runs the Rust test suite, `BuildRequires: gcc`, the effective licence
  of the binary (`GPL-3.0-or-later AND (MIT OR Apache-2.0)`), and a changelog
  entry for the version it builds; `.copr/Makefile` now ships the exact
  upstream GitHub archive as `Source0` for a release build, so its checksum
  matches the URL in the spec.
- **`man vox`.** A manual page covering every flag, the six-step `coreasm`
  resolution order, the files the compiler reads and writes, and four worked
  examples. Installed by `make install`, by the RPM, and by the Nix flake.
- VS Code extension 0.4.2: README links the website (vox-lang.dev, /docs/), `homepage` set in package.json, the README's Visual Studio Marketplace link fixed to `vox-lang.vox-lang`.

- **VS Code extension 0.4.1**: the grammar now scopes list/map literal
  punctuation — `[` `]` as `punctuation.section.brackets.begin/end.vox`,
  `{` `}` as `punctuation.section.braces.begin/end.vox`, the map key/value
  `:` as `punctuation.separator.key-value.vox`, and `,` as
  `punctuation.separator.comma.vox`. Previously these characters carried no
  scope at all inside a list or map literal (`a list called xs is [1, "two",
  nothing].`) while every value between them was already highlighted.

### Fixed

- **A `list`, `map` or `buffer` global written with `Set` at top level is
  still a global.** `Set roster to ["ada"].` after `a list called roster is
  [].` took the name out of scope entirely, so every function reading it was
  refused with `Unknown variable`, while the byte-equivalent `the roster is
  ["ada"].` compiled and ran; a write that names no type now claims no kind.
  The `Unknown variable` caret for a possessive read also lands on the read
  that failed rather than on the declaration ([#92](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- The diagnostic for reading the result of a `.lib` entry with no `,
  returning` clause cited LANGUAGE.md by line number; both citations had
  drifted onto unrelated text. It now cites the two sections by name,
  `(LANGUAGE.md "The .lib file")` and `(LANGUAGE.md "Consuming a
  library")`, matching the rest of the compiler's diagnostics (#93).
- LANGUAGE.md and the compiler's uninitialized-buffer warning said a fresh
  dynamic buffer starts with zero capacity; the runtime has always given it
  4096 bytes up front. LANGUAGE.md and the warning now say so (#93).
- `Set message to "x".` named `to` as the reserved keyword instead of `message`, and `The message is "x".` raised an unrelated internal-name error — both blamed whatever token happened to follow a reserved type noun used without `called`, instead of the type noun itself. Both statement forms (and the equivalent `a message is "x".`) now name the reserved word the author actually typed, matching the diagnostic the `a <type> called <name>` declaration path already gave (#94).
- **A name brought into being without a type noun is now locked to that
  type, and reads back as it** — `Set zoo to 5.` followed by `Set zoo to
  "text now".` compiled clean and printed `4198488`, the string's own
  address, instead of the compile error `a number called zoo is 5.` gives
  for the same write; and `Set label to "hello". Print label.` printed an
  address on the first read, no rewrite involved, as did a map. `Set NAME
  to VALUE.`, `the NAME is VALUE.` and `NAME is VALUE.` on a name that does
  not exist yet each declare it with the value's type, which is then fixed
  like any other declaration's — so `NAME's type` names it and says
  `(static)`, and a later write of another type is refused with the caret on
  the write and the note on the declaration. One untyped `Set` anywhere in a
  file used to switch the type lock off for that name in every spelling, and
  to make a read placed between an earlier write and that `Set` fail as
  "used before it is declared" ([#95](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).
- **A list handed to a function that appends to it stayed on the caller's
  homogeneous fast path**, so an element the callee stored reads back as its
  address: `To 'note whatever' with a list called noted and a text called
  label. append label to noted.`, called on an empty `noted`, made
  `Print "{noted's last}"` print `4198536` where the same append written at
  the caller printed `tail`. The heterogeneous pre-scan decided each
  function's lists in isolation, so a write through a `list` parameter never
  reached the list's owner. It now carries across the call: a list is widened
  to mixed at a call site unless the callee provably writes the one type the
  caller has already proven the list holds, so `'s first`, `'s last`,
  `element N of`, iteration and a `{...}` hole all read the slot's own
  runtime tag. A list only read by the function it is handed to, or given the
  type it already holds, keeps the fast path. Across a `.lib` boundary the
  widening is unconditional — a signature cannot say what a body writes — which
  also ends a segfault there: a library declaring `a list of text` was believed
  by a caller whose list held numbers, and the first read dereferenced the
  integer `1` ([#97](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).
- **An unrecognised format specifier compiled clean and quietly rendered as
  a bare `{name}`** — `{n:q}`, `{n:#x}` and `{n:zzz}` all printed `n`'s plain
  value with no warning, so a typo like `#x` for hex silently gave the wrong
  output. Any specifier that is not a width, a zero-padded width, a decimal
  precision, or one of the base letters is now a compile error naming what
  was written and the valid forms (#98).

## [0.4.10] - 2026-08-22

- **Libraries built by an older Vox must be rebuilt.** A `.so` exporting a
  function with a `list`, `map` or `buffer` parameter, and every program
  that `see`s it, must be built by the same 0.4.10 compiler: those
  parameters now carry the address of the caller's storage, so a collection
  grown inside the function reaches the caller instead of being lost
  ([#75](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md), [#90](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

### Fixed

- **A global declared below a function is read inside that function as a raw
  machine word** — `Print label.` inside a function defined above `a text
  called label is "hello".` printed `4198488`, the string's own address, while
  a `float` printed its IEEE-754 bits and a `list`, `map` or `buffer` a live
  heap address; only a `number` came back right, and no diagnostic was raised
  either way. Codegen now reads every top-level declaration's type in a
  pre-pass and gives it to each function body before generating it, so a
  global is read as its declared type wherever the declaration sits — flags
  included, which #32 had made order-independent only inside the analyzer
  ([#66](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A declared `float`, `map` or `buffer` return printed directly is now
  rendered by its own formatter, not the integer one** — `To 'give float'.
  Return a float, 2.5.` then `Print 'give float'.` printed
  `4612811918334230528`, the bit pattern of 2.5; a declared `map` or `buffer`
  return printed a heap address, and a map did so in every position,
  including through a `.lib` import. Declaring the return type is the first
  way out bug #45's diagnostic offers, so it now works for all eleven types
  ([#67](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A mixed list's element in the *expression* form of a format hole no
  longer prints as an integer** — `Print "{element 2 of nested}"` printed a
  live heap address that changed between runs, while `Print element 2 of
  nested.` printed `[2, 3]` on the same element in the same run; a text
  element printed a `.rodata` address and a decimal element its raw IEEE-754
  bits. The tag was loaded and then discarded: the hole's expression path
  rendered by the compiler's static guess instead of the slot's runtime tag.
  It now dispatches on that tag in every sink — Print, a text initializer,
  buffer `set`/`copy`/`append`, `write`, filesystem paths, `treating` clauses
  and function arguments — through the same renderers Print calls, so a
  `value` interpolated outside Print is right too. The two LANGUAGE.md
  sentences that documented the limitation are gone
  ([#68](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A `treating` clause whose match or replacement is a `value` now reads
  its runtime tag** — `print each item from [1, "-"] treating probe as "X".`,
  with `a value called probe is "-".`, printed `1` then a rodata address, and
  over a text list a `value` holding a number went into `_str_eq` as a
  `char*` and segfaulted. A `value` carries no tag at emit time, so the
  clause fell back to the static path #59 replaced; the tag test and the
  choice between comparing bytes and comparing registers are now runtime
  branches, and a fired substitution carries the replacement's own tag out
  with it ([#69](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **`append each <var> from <collection> treating <match> as <replacement>
  to <list>` now substitutes instead of dropping the clause** — the clause
  was parsed and thrown away, so `append each name from names treating "-"
  as "anon" to out.` appended `["ann", "-"]`, and over a range source the
  same sentence would not parse at all. Written after the destination it
  now names itself instead of falling through as `Expected a statement,
  got Treating` ([#70](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A format specifier other than a width now honours the value's type** —
  `{n:.2}` on a whole number read the integer's bits as a double and printed
  `0.00`; `{t:x}` on a `text` and `{b:x}` on a `buffer` printed the
  variable's ADDRESS, so two texts holding the same bytes printed two
  different numbers and a buffer printed a live heap pointer that moved
  between runs. v0.4.7 fixed this for the width specifier only (#36); the
  precision and radix paths never consulted the type at all. A precision on
  a whole number now prints it to that many places (`255.00`, exactly, for
  every number Vox can hold), and a specifier the type cannot answer — a
  radix on a `text`, a `buffer` or a `float`, a precision on a `text` or a
  `buffer` — is a compile error naming the cast, in #45/#62/#63/#65's family
  ([#71](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **An absent map key, or an out-of-range list index, is no longer typed
  from the collection's values** — `a map called guess is {"a": "t"}.`
  followed by the manual's own idiom, `a number called n is guess's
  "absent".`, was refused on 0.4.9 with "cannot initialise 'n', which is a
  number, with a text read out of map 'guess'"; 0.4.8 compiled it and printed
  `0`. A key the literal does not contain, and an index past a list literal's
  end, yield the **number** 0 (LANGUAGE.md:2429, :2857), so the read is now
  typed `number` whatever the collection holds. The `text` spelling that
  0.4.9's own `help:` line recommended dereferenced that 0 as a pointer and
  segfaulted; it is now a compile error naming the absent key. The proof is
  withheld — and the behaviour left exactly as it was — for any collection an
  `Append`, a `Set`, an alias or a call can reach
  ([#72](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A function definition swallowed into an open clause is now called with
  the right ABI** — a `To` written while a `For each`, `While`, `Repeat`,
  `If` or `on error` was still open is parsed into that clause's body, and
  the pre-passes that record each function's signature scanned only the
  top-level statement list, so every call to such a definition was compiled
  against an empty signature: a `value` parameter's tag word was never pushed
  and the callee read its tag from a register the caller never wrote, which
  turned an integer argument into a text pointer and segfaulted in eleven
  lines. The analyzer and codegen now find nested definitions through one
  shared sweep, so a call is compiled the same wherever the definition stands
  ([#73](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A `'s <property>` read is type-checked where it lands.** `a text
  called t is xs's length.` compiled and segfaulted on the first read, and
  so did the same value passed to a text parameter, returned from a text
  function, or assigned with `Set` — the type lock's oracle answered for
  `first` and `last` and treated every other property as "type unknown".
  Every property whose type is the same whatever it is read from now
  proves that type, so a mismatch is a compile error naming the two ways
  out; `first`, `last`, `absolute`, `duration` and `elapsed` are typed by
  what they are read from and stay unchecked ([#74](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A list or map grown through a function parameter reaches the caller,
  instead of stopping at the size its literal happened to allocate** —
  `append`ing to a `list` parameter (or inserting into a `map` parameter)
  silently stopped after `max(8, element count)` elements:
  `_list_append`/`_map_insert` returned the reallocated pointer and the
  callee stored it only into its own parameter slot, so the caller kept
  pointing at the block the collection outgrew. Every call past that
  reallocated afresh and dropped the new block, leaking a whole collection
  per call — 781 MiB of resident memory for a list that reported eight
  elements. A `list` or `map` argument now travels as the address of the
  caller's storage, the shape a `thing` argument already used, and the
  store-back writes the new pointer through it; growth arrives however many
  calls deep the collection was passed. **A `.so` exporting a function with
  a `list` or `map` parameter, and the programs that `see` it, must be
  rebuilt together: their calling convention changed**
  ([#75](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A `map` parameter is no longer typed as nothing at all** — `To 'show'
  with a map called holder. Print holder's length.` did not fail at runtime,
  it failed to **assemble**: `holder's length` emitted a call to
  `_file_size`, and NASM reported an undefined symbol that appears nowhere
  in the program, with no Vox diagnostic. The same parameter printed a raw
  heap address from `Print holder` and `"{holder}"`, and answered `-1` for
  `'s length` in the programs that did happen to link the file runtime. The
  declared-type to codegen-type table had been copied out four times and
  `map` had reached only the declaration's copy, so a map parameter — and a
  declared `map` return, whose result leaked an address the same way — fell
  to `Unknown`, which every property and print dispatch reads as the file
  branch. The four copies are now one `vartype_of_declared_type`. Found by
  the vox-fuzz candidate audit and adjudicated by the language lawyer
  ([#76](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- The `append` value slot now reads the values every other value position
  reads: a negative literal, `nothing`, `element N of <list>`, `byte N of
  <buffer>`, a `'s` possessive and the operator spelling `times` were
  refused there and accepted everywhere else — including inside `{...}` in
  the slot itself. The value was parsed by two hand-written copies of the
  general parser that had fallen behind it; it reads one primary now, with
  `to` still reserved as the append separator ([#77](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A buffer sized from a variable no longer escapes the size bound** —
  `a number called wanted is 0 minus 1.` followed by `a buffer called b is
  wanted bytes in size.` compiled and reported `capacity -1`, and a size past
  what the system can map (from a named number, a float read as its bit
  pattern, or an argument) built a null buffer that segfaulted on the first
  read. The 1..1073741824-byte bound lived in the parser's literal arm alone,
  so it was a rule about a spelling: `Create a buffer called b with capacity
  1073741825.` was never bounded at all. The bound is now held wherever a size
  is decided — at compile time for a size the compiler can prove, and at run
  time for one it cannot, where the buffer is made with no capacity and the
  error flag is raised for `On error` to catch. LANGUAGE.md now states the
  bound ([#78](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A top-level read written above the variable's own declaration is now a
  compile error** — `Print label.` above `a text called label is "hello".`
  used to compile clean and print `0`: the name resolved from a whole-program
  pre-pass while its type came from the in-order walk and was not there yet,
  so codegen formatted the zeroed `.bss` slot as an integer. The collection,
  map and buffer spellings of the same too-early read segfaulted instead —
  `append`, `element N of`, a map key read, `Clear`, `Resize`, `copy` and
  `For each` among them. The top-level walk now fills its scope in
  declaration order, and the read is answered with a diagnostic naming the
  line the declaration is on. A function body is unaffected: it runs when it
  is called, so it may still name a global declared further down the file
  ([#79](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A `thing` instance declared below a function can now be read inside it**
  — `Print origin's x.` inside a function was a parse error, `Expected
  property name, got Identifier("x")`, whenever `a point called origin.` was
  written below that function; the caret landed on the field name, the one
  token in the line that was not the problem. The write, the article
  spelling, the format hole, a chain through a nested thing and the instance
  possessive all failed the same way. LANGUAGE.md attaches no ordering
  condition to a top-level variable, and the rule it does state is about a
  thing *definition*, which the repro already obeyed. The parser now
  registers every top-level `a <thing> called <name>` declaration in one pass
  before the first statement is parsed — the whole-program answer the
  analyzer and codegen have always had. A thing used above its *definition*
  is still refused, and now says so instead of complaining about the field
  name ([#80](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A quoted map key inside a format hole is read as a key, not as the end
  of the hole** — `Print "[{scores's \"{key}\"}]".` printed `[1"}]`,
  rendering the right value and then spilling the hole's own `"` and `}` into
  the output; a key containing `}` or `:` was cut in half and quietly
  answered the wrong value. The hole parser scanned to the first `}` and
  split the format spec at the first `:` without noticing a quoted string in
  between. Both now step over quoted strings, so a dynamic key composes with
  a format hole as both features are documented
  ([#81](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A float read from text is now the same double as the same number
  written as a literal** — `"0.88" as a float` was not `0.88`, and 53 of
  the 1000 two-decimal values below ten disagreed with their own literal,
  because the runtime parser divided the fractional part by ten once per
  digit and every one of those divisions rounded. The whole decimal is now
  read as one mantissa and the point placed in a single rounding, so every
  decimal of up to 18 significant digits converts to exactly the double the
  compiler's own parser gives it. The same rewrite stops a long decimal
  wrapping the parser's accumulator — `"3.141592653589793238462643"` used
  to read as `2.999995446079999` and `"123456789012345678901.5"` as a
  negative number — and stops an empty buffer cast to a float handing back
  whatever float was computed last. Found by the vox-fuzz claim ledger row
  VAL-09 and adjudicated by the language lawyer
  ([#82](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **`not` now takes the whole condition after it, so `If not v1 is v2
  then,` is `not (v1 is v2)`** — `not` was parsed as an operator on a
  primary, so that guard compiled as `(not v1) is v2` and was false
  whatever the operands, and `not <comparison>` had no working spelling
  at all. A `not` level now sits between `and` and the comparisons,
  matching the `not <condition>` the manual documents, and `is not`,
  `not` in front of a boolean, and `not` in a printed value are
  unchanged ([#83](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **`isn't` and `aren't` now compile** — both have always been listed in
  LANGUAGE.md's Logical Operators table as spellings of `not`, but the lexer
  stopped reading a word at the apostrophe, so neither could ever be built
  and any program that used one was refused with `Expected a statement, got
  Apostrophe`. Each now lexes as the two words it stands for — `is not` and
  `are not` — while the four undocumented contractions that sat unreachable
  beside them in the same table (`doesn't`, `don't`, `it's`, `they're`) were
  removed rather than woken, so `print it's length.` stays the possessive on
  a variable called `it` ([#84](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A width and a precision written together in one format specifier now
  compose instead of dropping both** — `{f:8.2}` printed `2.5` though
  `{f:.2}` prints `2.50`, because the spec reader consumed the width and then
  matched the leftover `.2` against the base specifiers, where it fell to a
  catch-all and the precision was never assigned. Both halves are now read
  and both are kept: the precision decides the digits and the width decides
  the padding, each honoured wherever a primitive for it exists — the rule
  the width already followed on its own. `{n:8.2}` on a whole number prints
  `  255.00` and `{n:08.2}` prints `00255.00`; on a `float` the places are
  printed and the padding is not, because there is no float padder yet
  (#36's residue), exactly as a bare `{f:8}` already behaved. LANGUAGE.md,
  which never said whether `N.M` composes, now says
  ([#85](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A float's precision now renders in every sink, not just `Print`** —
  `{ratio:.2}` printed `2.50` to the terminal and `2.5` everywhere else: a
  text initializer, buffer `set`/`copy`/`append`, a `write` to a file and a
  function argument, so a receipt written to disk disagreed with the same
  line shown on screen. Those sinks now render the precision through the
  same routine `Print` uses, which LANGUAGE.md "Format Strings Everywhere"
  has always promised; every other specifier already agreed and is
  unchanged ([#86](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- A buffer stored in a `value` now carries its bytes instead of its struct
  pointer: `a value called carried is made.` printed an empty line (or the
  capacity byte — `@` for a 64-byte buffer) while `carried's type` reported
  `Text (dynamic)`. The same copy `as text` makes is now made at all five
  `value` write sites — declaration, `Set`, `the ... is`, a `value`
  argument, and `Return a value` ([#87](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **`Print not <text>` no longer segfaults** — a `not` is a boolean whatever
  it is applied to, but `infer_expr_type` and `is_float_expr` returned its
  OPERAND's type, so `Print` was told a boolean was text and dereferenced
  address 0; a list, a map and `"{not t}"` in a format string faulted the same
  way, and a float operand printed `0.0` where a boolean belongs. Both
  predicates now answer boolean for `not` and keep propagating the operand's
  type for `-x` ([#88](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **The "Unknown variable" caret for a bare literal in a format hole now
  points at the hole** — `Print "{3.14:.17}".` is rejected because a hole
  names a variable, not a literal, but the caret went looking for `3.14` as a
  name and marked the first one anywhere in the file: a legal `a float called
  f is 3.14.` three lines above. The symbol-location scan now asks whether the
  symbol could have been lexed as a name at all, and for one that could not —
  a literal the format parser handed back — looks for it inside the text
  literal it was written in instead of in code. Found by the language lawyer
  during the round-3 candidate audit ([#89](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **A `buffer` grown past its capacity through a parameter no longer
  segfaults the caller** — `To 'pad out' with a buffer called sink. append
  "0123456789" to sink.` called in a loop crashed the caller's next read of
  its own buffer, and one `Resize sink to 9000` was enough. Growing a buffer
  moves it and frees the block it grew out of, but the reallocated pointer
  stopped at the callee's frame, so the caller was left reading unmapped
  memory. A `buffer` parameter's argument word is now the address of the cell
  where the caller keeps its pointer, and the write-back happens at the
  reallocation rather than when the call returns, so a function called in
  between that reaches the same buffer sees it where it now lives. A `.so`
  exporting a function with a `buffer` parameter must be rebuilt with 0.4.10
  alongside its consumer, and a buffer reallocated across that boundary still
  faults in exit cleanup — recorded in the register as its own defect
  ([#90](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

- **An absent-key or out-of-range read into a `text`, `list` or `map` no
  longer segfaults** — a miss yields the number 0 and sets the error flag,
  and that 0 used to reach a pointer-typed destination and be dereferenced
  on the first read wherever the miss was not provable: a variable index, a
  dynamic key, an `Append`-grown list, a `Set`-grown map, a collection
  reached through a parameter. A miss now yields the destination's default
  value instead — `0` for a `number`, the empty text for a `text`, `[]` for
  a `list`, `{}` for a `map` — the same values a declaration with no
  initializer has written since #25. Where the miss *is* provable, #72's
  diagnostic still refuses the program before this rule is reached. The
  error flag is unchanged, so `On error` still catches every one of them
  ([#91](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)).

## [0.4.9] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **`For each` over a scalar, a map or a buffer is now a compile error
  instead of a crash or garbage** ([#49](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `print
  each part from 4.`, a two-token program, segfaulted; so did `For each
  part in n,` and `append each part from 4 to out.` over a number or a
  text. A map or a buffer instead iterated silently over nonsense (a
  3-entry map ran 3 iterations printing `0, 0, 3`; the buffer `"abc"`
  printed `6513249`, its own bytes read as a qword). The analyzer checked
  only that the collection name was defined, and codegen unconditionally
  read `[ptr + 8]` as a list header's element count — so a number was
  dereferenced as an address and a map's or buffer's own header was
  misread as a list's. LANGUAGE.md's supported collections are a list, a
  range and `arguments's all`; the analyzer now refuses what it can prove
  is none of them, suggesting `'s keys` or `'s values` for a map. It is a
  known-scalar rejection, not a whitelist: an untyped parameter, a
  `value`, a function result and a property read all keep iterating.
  Found by the vox-fuzz collections-b claim ledger (discrepancies D3 and
  D4) and adjudicated by the language lawyer as one memory-safety bug.

- **A bare `otherwise` is accepted after any base action, not just
  `append`** ([#50](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `print gauge, but if gauge is
  greater than 50 print "high", otherwise print "low".` was rejected with
  `Expected a statement, got Otherwise`, and `increment n, otherwise
  increment n` failed identically, though LANGUAGE.md documents the bare
  clause at :393, :399, :2960 and :2966 and says `but if` works over any
  base action. The chain-continuation guard in `parse_conditional_suffix`
  omitted `Else` and `Otherwise`; only the terse `append` branch left a
  comma behind for the guard to consume, which is why that one spelling
  worked. The guard now accepts both keywords and no longer consumes them
  as separators. Found by the vox-fuzz collections-b claim ledger
  (discrepancy D2) and adjudicated by the language lawyer.

- **A text-valued special name built into a buffer no longer segfaults**
  ([#52](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `copy "{arguments's first}" to built`
  crashed the generated program (exit 139), as did `{arguments's
  second/last/name/all/raw}` and `{environment's first}`, through all
  three buffer verbs (`set`, `copy`, `append`). LANGUAGE.md promises
  every sink shares one name resolver, so these render identically
  whether printed, written to a file, or built into a buffer — and
  printing and writing them were always correct. The buffer sink loaded
  its destination pointer into `rdi` before resolving the part's value,
  but resolving an argument property passes its index in `rdi` to call
  `_get_arg`, so the append that followed dereferenced an index instead
  of a buffer. The destination is now loaded once the value is settled,
  which is the order the stack-slot sink beside it already used and why
  that one never crashed. The numeric specials (`{arguments's count}`,
  `{current time's hour}`) had been surviving the same path by luck.
  Regression test `tests/bug52_argv_property_into_buffer.vox`, proven to
  segfault on 0.4.8 and to pass after, plus a codegen test that locks
  the instruction order. Found by the vox-fuzz Input/Output claim ledger
  (discrepancy D1).

- **`Return a buffer, "<text>"` is a compile error instead of an empty
  buffer or a segfault** ([#53](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `To 'give
  literal'. Return a buffer, "ABC".` handed the caller the address of the
  literal's characters with no buffer header in front of them, and the
  caller's `_buffer_append` then read eight bytes past the first
  character as a length and copied that many bytes. With one
  string-initialised buffer in the program the call answered a silently
  **empty** buffer (`size` printed `0`); with two it **segfaulted** (139)
  — one defect reading different bytes, and which one a program got
  depended on what the assembler happened to lay down after the literal.
  LANGUAGE.md:722-727 makes `buffer` a legal `Return a <type>,` return
  type and nothing more; the single place the manual gives text a buffer
  meaning is the declaration initializer `a buffer called buf is
  "Hello".`. A text literal or a text variable returned as a buffer is
  now refused with a fix-it — build the buffer first, return the variable
  — while returning a buffer variable, a buffer parameter, or another
  buffer-returning call is untouched. Regression tests
  `tests/compile_fail/099_return_buffer_text_literal.vox` and
  `100_return_buffer_text_variable.vox`, both proven to segfault on
  unfixed `main`, plus the passing control
  `tests/bug53_return_buffer_variable.vox`. Found by the vox-fuzz
  Functions claim ledger (discrepancies D7 and D8).

- **A collection element read into a variable of another type is a
  compile error, not a segfault** ([#54](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `a list
  called counts is [1, 2].` then `label is element 1 of counts.` into a
  `text` crashed the generated program (139) with no output at all, and
  the reverse direction — a text element into a `number` — silently
  printed `4198536`, an address. Printing the read directly was always
  correct, so the read, its bounds check and its tag dispatch all worked;
  it was the copy into a differently-typed slot that broke. The analyzer
  answered "can't prove it, allow it" for every element, `'s first`/`'s
  last`, byte and map read, and codegen then emitted a plain quadword
  move, so `Print` picked its printer from the destination's declared
  type and walked a number as a `char *`. LANGUAGE.md:530-541 fixes a
  variable's type at its declaration and says every form that writes to a
  declared name is checked the same way: a homogeneous list literal's
  proven element type now reaches both the assignment type lock and the
  declaration site, which had no type check at all, and a `For each` loop
  variable over a proven list carries it too. The proof is only offered
  where it holds — a list that any `Append`, element write, whole-list
  assignment, call argument or copy could widen gets no element type, and
  a mixed list still reads through `value` unchanged. Regression tests
  `tests/compile_fail/106_element_number_list_into_text.vox` through
  `112_foreach_element_into_mistyped_variable.vox`, plus the passing
  controls `tests/bug54_element_read_typecheck.vox` and
  `tests/bug54_helper_widens_a_list.vox`. Found by the vox-fuzz Variables
  claim ledger (discrepancy D1).

- **A `treating` clause whose types do not match the collection is a
  compile error instead of a segfault** ([#55](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) —
  `print each item from ["a"] treating 98 as 31.`, one line, compiled
  clean and died with 139; over a named text list it crashed identically,
  and over a range (`each step from 1 to 3 treating "a" as "b"`) the
  clause silently never fired. The analyzer already compared a
  `treating` clause's match against its replacement, but never against
  the thing being substituted: `infer_simple_expr_type` answers `None`
  for a plain name, so the loop variable — which holds an element of the
  collection — was invisible to the check. Codegen was meanwhile
  confident enough to pick the text comparison from the subject's type
  alone and hand `_str_eq` the number 98 as a `char *`. The subject's
  type is now resolved through `named_value_type`, which reads the
  element type an `each` loop records for its variable, and a list
  literal in the loop header supplies one the same way a named list
  already did. Where the element type cannot be proven — a list widened
  by a later `Append` — codegen no longer dereferences a match value
  that cannot be text, so the substitution simply never fires instead of
  faulting. A mixed list is left to the runtime, as `value` always is.
  Found by the vox-fuzz basics-expansion claim ledger (discrepancies D3
  and D4), master-reproduced.

- **`all the numbers from/between …` no longer segfaults outside a loop
  header, and both spellings now include their end bound**
  ([#56](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `For each step in all the numbers between
  1 and 3,` crashed the generated program (exit 139), and so did `a list
  called steps is all the numbers from 1 to 3.` followed by `Print
  steps.`, which printed `[` and died. The same phrase printed straight
  out gave `0`, and as an arithmetic operand gave the other operand back.
  LANGUAGE.md:4716 names the phrase a **range**, and :262 says a range is
  "**not** allocated as lists - they compile directly to efficient loop
  constructs", so it has no value to emit: codegen's arm for it emitted
  nothing at all and left the accumulator's previous contents to be
  stored in a list slot or dereferenced as a list header. Every `For
  each` header handed a range now routes to the range loop through the
  same helper loop expansion has always used — which is why `Print each
  step from all the numbers between 1 and 3.` was the one spelling that
  worked — and a range anywhere a value is expected is a compile error
  naming the documented spelling, `For each n from 1 to 3,`. Separately,
  that one working position was answering wrongly: the parse site read
  inclusiveness off which preposition was written, so `all the numbers
  from 1 to 3` yielded `1 2` while `between 1 and 3` yielded `1 2 3`,
  against :277's "Ranges are **inclusive**". Both spellings are one
  range, and both now reach their end. Regression tests
  `tests/361_foreach_over_all_the_numbers.vox` and
  `tests/362_all_the_numbers_is_inclusive.vox` plus three compile-fail
  fixtures, proven to crash or answer wrongly on 0.4.8 and to pass after.
  Found by the vox-fuzz keywords claim ledger (discrepancies D5, D6 and
  D7).

- **`nothing` in a concretely-typed slot is now a compile error instead of
  a segfault or a silent `0`** ([#57](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `a text
  called t is nothing.` followed by `Print t.` crashed the generated
  program (exit 139); a list did the same after printing `[`, and a map
  after `{`. The declaration alone was harmless — the read was the fault,
  which put the crash a line away from its cause. LANGUAGE.md:2660-2661
  says where the literal may sit, "a list slot, a map value, or a `value`
  parameter or return", and the bare-`Create` defaults table (:489-501)
  gives `nothing` to `value` alone, so a `text`/`list`/`map` variable has
  no representation for it: codegen stored the literal's payload, 0, with
  no tag beside it, and the read dispatched on the declared type and
  dereferenced a null pointer. The quiet half was the same defect wearing
  a plausible answer — a `number` initialised to `nothing` printed `0`,
  against :2685's "**`nothing` is not zero**" and against the compile
  error `nothing add 1` already raised for exactly that reason. The
  literal is now refused wherever it is written into a slot of any
  concrete type: a declaration, an assignment, a call argument, and a
  return, each diagnostic naming the type and offering both ways out — a
  `value`, or that type's own empty value. Every position the manual does
  give the literal is untouched, pinned by
  `tests/363_nothing_in_its_documented_places.vox`, whose output is
  byte-identical before and after; seven compile-fail fixtures
  (`tests/compile_fail/119`-`125`) cover the rejections, each proven to
  crash or answer wrongly on 0.4.8+#49-#56. The same crash reached at run
  time — through a `value`, or a collection whose element type cannot be
  proven — is recorded in BUGS_FOUND and not fixed here. Found by the
  vox-fuzz random-literals worker's probes (§4 D1),
  master-reproduced.

- **A buffer declared from a text-valued property keeps its type — and,
  on `Set`, its bounds** ([#58](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `a buffer called
  home is environment's "HOME".` copied the bytes in correctly and then
  lost the name's type, so `Print home.` printed an empty line and
  `home's size` answered `-1`; the same for `environment's
  first`/`last` and every `arguments's` positional, while the two-step
  spelling through a `text` variable was always right. LANGUAGE.md:531
  says "**A variable's type is fixed at its declaration and never
  changes**", and :3285 explains a buffer reports `(static)` precisely
  because "the compiler knows the type from the declaration" — but
  codegen re-read the type off the initializer's shape, saw an
  environment or argument read, and re-labelled the buffer as text, so
  every later read dispatched as text and `size` fell through to the
  file fallback `_file_size`. The `Set b to <property>` spelling was
  worse than a wrong answer: the decision to treat the destination as a
  buffer is read back out of the same table, so a re-labelled buffer
  stopped copying bytes into its struct and stored the raw `argv`
  pointer over the buffer pointer — `capacity` then read the argument's
  own bytes as the capacity, no position could exceed it, and `Set byte
  N of b` wrote into the process's argument block, segfaulting at a
  large `N`. The declare-with-initializer arm now carries the guard the
  bare-assignment arm beside it already had. Regression tests
  `tests/364_buffer_from_named_environment_variable.vox`,
  `365_buffer_from_positional_environment_property.vox`,
  `366_buffer_from_argument_property.vox` and
  `367_set_buffer_to_argument_keeps_its_bounds.vox`, proven to answer
  wrongly or segfault on 0.4.8 and to pass after. Found by the vox-fuzz
  environment claim ledger (discrepancy D1) and re-found by the
  fuzzer's environment leaves (ASSERT ENV-03/ENV-06).

- **The documented file property `exists` is now a clear compile error
  instead of a bare parser complaint** ([#38](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) —
  `Print h's exists.` on an open handle failed with `Expected property
  name, got Exists`, which named the token but not the problem.
  `exists` described an open handle, but a handle that opened
  successfully already proves the file exists, so the property answered
  nothing; LANGUAGE.md's File Properties table has been corrected to
  drop the row and document the idiom that answers the real question —
  open the path inside an `On error` handler — with a worked example
  covering both an existing and a missing path. The parser now names
  that idiom directly when `exists` appears in property position. A
  path-level `exists` predicate remains a planned future addition, noted
  in the manual rather than promised as syntax. Regression tests
  `tests/compile_fail/141_file_handle_exists_property.vox` (the
  diagnostic) and `tests/390_file_exists_idiom.vox` (the documented
  idiom, both branches).

- **A list or map interpolated into a format string renders everywhere,
  not just in `Print`** ([#44](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `Print "{flat}"`
  gave `[1, 2, 3]`, but `a text called captured is "{flat}".` and `copy
  "{flat}" to sink.` gave `140237428518912`: the collection's heap
  address, formatted as a decimal integer, and a different address on
  every run. Maps behaved identically. LANGUAGE.md:3133-3136 says a
  format string used as a value materializes into a fresh string, and
  :3157-3163 says every string-taking statement accepts one and all sinks
  render identically — neither with a type restriction. `Print` special-
  cased `List` and `Map` inside its own emitter, while every other sink
  went through `emit_append_runtime_value_to_buffer_ptr`, which had arms
  for `Buffer`, `String` and `Float` and no arm for a collection, so both
  fell to the integer formatter. Rather than write a second, buffer-
  shaped renderer, the existing one was redirected: `_list_print` and
  `_map_print` now emit through `RENDER_*` macros that consult a
  `_render_sink`, which is zero for stdout and a buffer pointer
  otherwise, so the text initializer, buffer `set`/`copy`/`append`,
  `write`, filesystem paths, `treating` clauses and function arguments
  all render through the very routine `Print` calls. Nested lists, empty
  collections, a mixed list's quoted strings and floats, and a cyclic
  list's `...` truncation therefore come out identical in every sink. A
  whole `thing` in a text initializer is still the compile error
  LANGUAGE.md:1224-1227 documents — a thing's fields are written out at
  compile time and it has no runtime renderer to redirect. Found while
  fixing this: `{'the running total'}` (a quoted name) and `{[1, 2]}` (a
  bare literal) parse as expressions, not variable parts, and `Print`'s
  expression arm had a `Map` case but never a `List` one, so those two
  spellings printed an address in `Print` position too; that arm's list
  twin is here. Six regression tests, `tests/368_…` through
  `tests/373_…`, one per sink, all proven to print heap addresses on
  unfixed `main` and to pass after. Found by the vox-fuzz collections-a
  claim ledger (discrepancy D7) and adjudicated by the language lawyer.

- **A call with no declared return type is a compile error where nothing
  supplies one, instead of being read as a number**
  ([#45](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `To 'opaque label'. Return "hi".` followed
  by `print 'opaque label'.` printed `4198488`, the rodata address of
  `"hi"`; routed through a declared `text` first it printed `hi`. The
  returned value was always intact — the read was wrong, and wrong
  precisely where nothing supplied a type. The same confusion reached a
  list slot (`append 'opaque label' to items.` then `print element 1`,
  giving `4210906`, stable across runs so the wrong answer looked like
  data), a map value, a list literal, `set element`, a `{...}`
  interpolation and a `value` declaration. LANGUAGE.md:649-660 names this
  exact shape — "a function pointer, printed as a number, silently. No
  error, no warning; the program runs and gives a wrong answer that looks
  like data" — as the thing the 0.3.0 identifier/literal split was written
  to kill, so guessing `number` and staying silent was the one option the
  language's own philosophy ruled out. The analyzer now refuses the read
  and names both ways out: declare the return type, or assign the result
  to a declared variable first. The rejection is scoped to positions that
  supply no type of their own — a declared variable, a reassignment to
  one, an argument landing on a declared parameter, and a comparison
  against a typed operand were never broken and are untouched. Seven
  compile-fail fixtures and three passing controls, proven wrong on
  0.4.8 and right after; the mixed-list section of LANGUAGE.md, which
  documented the old guess and gave a worked example of it, is rewritten,
  and a "Reading a result" subsection states the rule under Functions.
  Full runtime tag propagation (stage 1d) is what would let such a call
  carry its own tag. Found by the vox-fuzz collections-a claim ledger
  (discrepancy D5) and adjudicated by the language lawyer, who found the
  defect broader than the mixed-list case the ledger reported.

- **A diagnostic's caret no longer lands in a comment, in a text literal,
  or in the middle of a longer word** ([#46](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — a
  three-line program whose first line is the comment `(mentions hello
  here)` reported its `Unknown variable: hello` at `1:11`, pointing inside
  the comment instead of at the `hello` on line 3. `Print "hello".` above
  the same use captured the caret the same way, and a one-letter name
  anchored inside a longer word: with `print "counting".` above it,
  `append 1 to n.` put its caret on the `n` of `print`. The analyzer
  locates these errors by searching the raw source for the name — the
  AST carries no span for an identifier — and the search had no idea what
  it was reading: first textual hit anywhere, substring match, comments
  and literals included. It is a trap laid for whoever documents their
  repro, since a header comment naming the construct under test is
  exactly what an unlucky first hit looks like. The scan is now
  region-aware and whole-word: every byte of the source is classified the
  way the lexer itself reads it — nested and multi-line `( … )` comments,
  text literals with their escapes, character literals and quoted
  identifiers — a name mentioned in a comment is never a caret, and a hit
  in real code always outranks one inside a literal. Interpolation is
  untouched: a name that only ever appears as `{name}` inside a text
  still anchors there. The classifier is pinned against the lexer by a
  test asserting no token the lexer emits can start inside what the
  classifier calls a comment. Regression tests
  `tests/compile_fail/137_caret_skips_a_comment_mention.vox` through
  `140_caret_skips_a_multi_line_comment_mention.vox`. Found by the
  language lawyer while adjudicating the vox-fuzz collections-a claim
  ledger, whose every probe file mis-pointed this way.

- **A buffer put into a text no longer needs the cast, and never yields
  the buffer's header** ([#51](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `a text called t is
  b.` stored the buffer's struct pointer in the text slot, so `Print t.`
  read the 24-byte header as a C string and printed the capacity field's
  low byte: `@` for a 64-byte buffer, `A` for a 65-byte one. It was
  stable across mutation — clearing and refilling `b` changed nothing,
  because the text never touched the data — so the only symptom was one
  wrong character that had looked the same since it was written. Four
  more spellings put a cast-free buffer into a text slot; `'show it'
  with b.` into a `text` parameter and `Return a text, b.` were wrong
  the same way, while `Set t to b.` and `the t is b.` were refused by
  the type lock, which named a cast that would not have changed what the
  sentence meant. LANGUAGE.md's Basic Conversions table gives `buffer →
  text` one meaning — "a copy of the buffer's bytes" — and the language
  designer ruled that the cast-free spellings say the same thing, so all
  five now make that copy and `b as text` and `"{b}"` still agree with
  them word for word. The copy the cast emitted inline became
  `emit_buffer_to_text_copy`, called from one place by all of them
  rather than written out per site, which is how #58's two spellings
  drifted apart. Type immutability is untouched: `t` is text before the
  write and text after it, and every other mismatched write is still a
  compile error. Regression tests
  `tests/385_text_from_buffer_copies.vox`,
  `386_text_from_buffer_at_every_write_site.vox` and
  `387_text_from_buffer_is_an_independent_copy.vox` — the last pinning
  #41's promise through #51's spelling, that clearing, refilling and
  resizing the buffer leave the text exactly as it was. Found by the
  vox-41 fix worker probing sibling forms of bug #41.


- **A `treating` clause over a mixed list keeps each element's runtime
  tag** ([#59](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `print each item from [1, "a"]
  treating "a" as "b".` printed `1` then `4198536`, the text's own
  address; so did `treating 98 as 31`, and so did `treating 1 as 9`,
  which substituted the number correctly and then printed the `"a"` it
  had not touched as a pointer. The same list with no clause printed
  `1` then `a`. LANGUAGE.md promises a mixed list's elements "carry a
  small per-slot type tag at runtime, so every element prints and reads
  back as what it is" (:2226-2228) and names iteration among the reads
  that respect it (:2236), while the clause itself replaces an element
  only "if the loop variable equals `<match>`" (:424) — so an element the
  clause never matches must print unchanged. Wrapping the loop variable
  in `treating` reported the subject's static type, which a mixed list
  does not have: the comparison became a raw pointer `cmp` (so a text
  element never matched a text match) and the result reached Print
  untagged (so it was rendered as an integer). Where the subject carries
  a runtime tag, the clause now dispatches on it — a differing tag means
  the substitution cannot fire and nothing is read through the match, an
  agreeing tag compares text by bytes and everything else in registers,
  and a replacement that fires carries its own tag. The value and its tag
  come out under the same contract a bare element read has, so Print,
  `value` parameter passing and an `is a` guard downstream all see what
  the element really is. This is the runtime half of #55, which rejected
  the provable mismatch and left the mixed list to the runtime; a subject
  with a static type keeps the static path untouched. Regression tests
  `tests/400_treating_a_mixed_list_keeps_each_tag.vox` through
  `406_treating_survives_an_is_a_guard_downstream.vox`, proven to print
  pointers on 0.4.8+#49-#58 and to pass after, with #55's
  `359`/`360` unchanged as controls. Found by the #55 fix worker
  (REPORT-55 §6), master-reproduced.

- **`{f:.N}` prints N correctly-rounded decimal places for any N**
  ([#60](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `{pi:.17}` was right, `{pi:.18}` printed
  `3.141589999999999872` where the double's exact expansion says
  `…883`, `{pi:.19}` printed `4.-8584100000000001280` — a wrong integer
  part with a `-` inside the fraction — and from `{pi:.20}` the digits
  were `3.0-9223372036854775808`, `i64::MIN` spliced in whole. The same
  sentinel was the integer part of every value at or beyond 2^63, so
  `{big:.2}` on 1e22 printed
  `-9223372036854775808.-9223372036854775808`. LANGUAGE.md:3106
  documents "N decimal places" with no bound on N, and a double — being
  a binary fraction — always has an exact finite decimal expansion to
  print them from. The old routine scaled the whole fraction by 10^N and
  converted it in one step, three ways and wrong three ways: a
  `mulsd`-by-10 loop that accumulated rounding error, a 10^N carry
  threshold built with `imul` that wrapped negative past `i64::MAX`, and
  a `cvttsd2si` that returns the SSE "integer indefinite" value once its
  source overflows. Nothing is scaled now: the value is taken apart as
  `m * 2^e`, an integer part at or above 2^52 comes from the same
  big-integer digit routine the default float printer uses (so `{f}` and
  `{f:.N}` agree on every value), and the fraction's digits are produced
  one at a time by repeated exact halving in decimal. Rounding happens
  once, on those digits, with an exact tie going to the even digit, as
  `printf` does — so `{9.9999:.0}` is now `10` where it used to truncate
  to `9`. Checked digit-for-digit against glibc `printf("%.*f")` over
  979 value/precision pairs, including the smallest subnormal (1074
  places), the largest double, the 2^52/2^53/2^63 boundaries and N up to
  1500. Regression test `tests/410_float_precision_any_places.vox`,
  proven to print the corrupt bands on 0.4.8 and to pass after. Found by
  the vox-fuzz literals worker's format-specifier probes (§4 D2),

- **A pad width is honoured at any size it can be written, and is written
  a page at a time** ([#61](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `{n:2147483648}`
  printed with no padding at all and no diagnostic, because the width
  was read with `parse::<i32>()` inside an `if let` with no else arm: one
  past `i32::MAX` the parse failed, the `Err` was dropped, and the spec
  came out identical to a bare `{n}`. A width that did parse was then
  padded one `write(2)` per character — about 265 KB/s, which is why
  `{n:1000000}` took two and a half seconds and `{n:100000000}` took
  nearly five minutes. LANGUAGE.md:3107-3108 puts no ceiling on a width,
  and none is intended: a width is a character count, rendered in full.
  So the count is now read as an `i64` and reaches the printer whatever
  it is — `{n:2147483648}` pads, in 1.3 s — and a count too large to
  hold is a compile error naming the limit instead of a silent no-op.
  The padding is written a 4096-byte page at a time (100 000 000
  characters: 283 s before, 0.065 s after), through a writer that
  resumes after a short write. The same parse fed the zero-pad and the
  hex, binary and octal width forms, and the same per-character loop was
  in all four padded printers; `{f:.N}` had the identical dropped `Err`
  on its precision. All of them are fixed together. Regression tests

  `tests/compile_fail/169_pad_width_past_what_vox_can_count.vox`,

- **A `.lib` entry with no `, returning` clause can no longer be read as a
  value** ([#62](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `a number called n is greet.`
  against a library whose Table of Contents says `To greet.` compiled
  clean and answered `1`, the leftover in the return register from a
  function that never set it. LANGUAGE.md:4963-4965 says a missing
  `returning` clause "means the function returns nothing", and step 5 of
  consuming a library (LANGUAGE.md:4990) promises calls "type-check like
  any other function" — a promise the parameter side already kept (arity
  and argument types are both checked at the call site) and the result
  side did not, on the identical `see`. Reading such a call's result is
  now a compile error naming the entry, pointing at the use, and offering
  both ways out: declare the return in the `.lib`, or call the function as
  a statement. Statement calls of a void export — the reason to export one
  — are untouched. Regression test `see/void-result` in `test.sh` (A4.5).
  Found by the vox-fuzz libraries claim ledger (Discrepancy 4) and filed
  on the language designer's ruling.

- **A procedure's non-existent result can no longer be used as a value**
  ([#63](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `To ping. Print "pong".` followed by
  `print ping.` printed `pong` and then `1`, and `a number called n is
  ping.` put that same `1` into `n`: not an answer, just whatever the call
  left behind. The Functions section defines the parameterless procedure
  (LANGUAGE.md:684-686) and gives it a home as a statement
  (LANGUAGE.md:779-785), but never hands a value back from a function that
  returns none — and LANGUAGE.md:656-660 names this exact shape, "a wrong
  answer that looks like data", as what the language exists to refuse. The
  analyzer's signature pre-pass now records every `To` with no
  value-returning `Return` at any depth, and reading one's result — in a
  declaration, a `print`, a list slot, a map value, a format hole, a
  `value`, a comparison, an argument to another call, a `Set`, an `Append`
  or a `Return` — is a compile error naming the function and offering both
  ways out. A bare `Return.` counts as returning nothing; a function that
  does return a value without declaring its type is a different bug (#45)
  and is untouched here. Calling a procedure as a statement stays legal.
  Regression tests `tests/compile_fail/158_procedure_result_in_a_declaration.vox`

- **`the h's descriptor` reads the property, like `h's descriptor`
  always did** ([#64](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `the` is only an article
  before a variable name (LANGUAGE.md:1857, :523, :887), so the two
  possessive spellings are one reading. They were two lists: the parser
  resolved `name's property` in one arm of `parse_primary` and `the
  name's property` in another, each with its own hand-written property
  arms, and the second knew only the time and timer properties plus
  `size`/`length`/`capacity`/`empty`/`full`. Every file property but
  `size`, both list-element properties, a map's `keys`/`values` and its
  key read, all seven number properties and a buffer's `type` answered
  `Expected property name` behind the article — while the *quoted*
  timer names (`t's 'start time'`) and the misspelled-`arguments`
  suggestion had drifted the other way and worked only *with* it. Both
  spellings now call one `parse_possessive_tail`, which holds the
  specials, the typo diagnostic, the map-key read, every property arm,
  #38's `exists` explanation, the `start time` two-word follower and
  the duration unit — so a property is added or diagnosed in exactly one
  place, the lesson #51 and #58 already taught about a second copy of a
  list. `the` before a reserved word is untouched and still rejected:
  `arguments`, `environment` and `current time` are not variable names,
  and the manual gives them their own `the`-led phrases. Regression
  tests `tests/420_the_possessive_reads_file_properties.vox` through
  `424_the_possessive_on_numbers_and_timers.vox` and

  worker probing the file-property surface, master-confirmed.

- **A declaration whose initializer is the wrong type is a compile error
  instead of a segfault or a wrong value** ([#65](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) —
  `a text called n is 5.` followed by `Print n.` dereferenced the literal
  5 as a text pointer and crashed (139); `a number called n is "get
  five".` printed `4198488`, the string's own address, which is
  LANGUAGE.md:647-667's worked example still printing the number the
  manual says it no longer prints. A boolean took the same pointer, a
  text into a float silently answered `0.0`, a number into a list
  segfaulted, and a text into a map printed `{}`. The type lock has
  enforced LANGUAGE.md:531-532 — "**A variable's type is fixed at its
  declaration and never changes**" — on every write to an
  already-declared name since 0.3.0, so `Set n to "x".` was refused,
  but nothing checked the declaration itself, which is where the type is
  chosen. `check_initialiser_type` now applies the lock's own
  compatibility rule at the declaration, and `check_argument_type` /
  `check_return_type` close the identical hole at a call's argument and
  at a return (`greet with 5.` on a text parameter, `Return a text, 5.`)
  — the three sites bug #57 already covered for `nothing`. The
  diagnostic names both types and the two ways out: redeclare, or the
  cast LANGUAGE.md's Basic Conversions table documents. Deliberately
  untouched: a `value` destination or source, a buffer's content write,
  the `file`/`time`/`timer` handles whose documented initializers are of
  another type (LANGUAGE.md:503-519 — `a file called source is
  "input.txt".`), a `thing` copy, and a buffer read into a text without
  the cast, which is bug #51's still-open question. Regression tests
  `tests/compile_fail/145`–`157`, all thirteen proven to
  compile-and-misbehave on 9734e5d, plus the passing controls

  `tests/396_mistyped_initialisers_written_correctly.vox`. Found by the
  #51 fix worker and by the vox-fuzz names-and-strings claim ledger
  (discrepancy D1).

- **`a float called ratio is 3.` holds 3.0 instead of 0.0**
  ([#65](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — a whole number into a float stored the
  integer's raw bits, which the float slot then read as 1.5e-323 and
  printed as `0.0`; `ratio add 1.0` answered `1.0` and `ratio multiply
  2.0` answered `0.0`. Per the language designer's ruling — "in human
  language we call 1 a number and pi a number; it should be the same in
  Vox" — a number and a float are one family, so the declaration converts
  rather than refusing, emitting the same two instructions `3 as a float`
  already emitted. The analyzer also stops relabelling a declared float
  from its initializer's shape, which is why `a float called f is 3.`
  followed by `Set f to 4.0.` used to answer "cannot assign float to 'f',
  which is a number" and now works. `a number called n is 3.5.` keeps its
  3.5, unchanged. The type lock still refuses `Set f to 3.` and `Set n to
  3.5.` one line later; that is the designer's own static-int64 gap, left
  with them, along with the float parameter and float return that still
  misread a whole number (both recorded under #65).

## [0.4.8] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **`Write` of a number, float, boolean, or `value` is a compile error,
  not a segfault** ([#40](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `Write n to out`
  compiled and then crashed the generated program (exit 139) for all
  three scalars, while text, buffers, and format strings wrote
  correctly: `Write` hands its operand to `FILE_WRITE_STR`, which reads
  it as a pointer to text, so a scalar's *value* was used as an address
  (n = 72 read address 72). LANGUAGE.md documents `Write` for text,
  buffers, and format strings, so the analyzer now refuses a bare scalar
  operand the way `append` refuses a number source, naming the operand,
  its type, and the spelling that works: `Write "{n}" to out.` A `value`
  operand is refused with it — it crashed the same way when it held a
  number or `nothing`, and the compiler cannot tell that from the
  text-holding case that worked — and its message names the fix verified
  for every case a value can hold: copy it into a typed variable and
  write that. Rendering a scalar directly remains an open design option;
  this pass fixes the diagnostic, not the language. Found by a human
  writing ordinary Vox while building vox-fuzz's stdin input
  generation.

- **`buffer as text` now copies the buffer instead of aliasing it**
  ([#41](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — the cast returned a pointer into the
  buffer's data area, so a text made from a buffer was a window onto it,
  not a value. Clearing and refilling the buffer silently rewrote every
  text taken from it, with no diagnostic; and because resizing a buffer
  frees its old allocation, as the manual's Buffer Resizing section says
  it does, reading such a text after a resize was a use-after-free —
  both directions segfaulted from eight lines of ordinary code, in a
  language whose headline promise is memory safety. `as text` now copies
  the buffer's bytes into a fresh dynamic buffer, the same allocation
  format strings and the other text-producing casts use, so exit cleanup
  tracks it identically. Regression test
  `tests/buffer_as_text_copies.vox`; LANGUAGE.md's conversion table and
  Buffer Resizing notes now state that the text is an independent copy.
  Found while writing an ordinary Vox program that read lines from a
  file into a list.

- **A buffer's `type` property reports `Buffer (static)` however it was
  declared** ([#42](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `a buffer called b is 16
  bytes in size`, `is 16 bytes`, `Create a buffer called b with size 16`,
  and the bare dynamic `a buffer called b.` all printed `Text (dynamic)`
  from `b's type`, against LANGUAGE.md's explicit listing of `buffer`
  among the statically-typed kinds; only the string-initialised `is
  "seed"` form was right. Every sized and dynamic spelling routes through
  `BufferDecl`, which registered the variable's runtime kind but never
  its declared type, so the property's lookup missed and fell through to
  the runtime-tag dispatch, where a buffer pointer reads as a string tag.
  The declaration now registers the declared type; the same omission on
  `Get the current time into` is closed alongside it so a `time` reports
  `Time (static)`. Found by the vox-fuzz buffer claim ledger (discrepancy
  D2) and adjudicated by the language lawyer.

- **A conditional `value` return no longer segfaults the caller**
  ([#43](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — a function whose only `Return` sat
  inside an `If`/`Otherwise` (`To label with a value called v. If v is a
  number, return a value, v. Otherwise, return a value, 99.`) crashed
  its caller with SIGSEGV, deterministically: the integer `99` was
  dereferenced as a `char*` inside `_print_cstr_impl`. The parser's Gate
  B fed a `Return`'s declared type into the function's signature only
  for **top-level** body statements, so a branch-nested `Return` left
  `return_type` at `Void`; codegen then skipped the `value` return's r11
  tag load, and the caller stored r11 into the variable's tag slot
  anyway — r11 still holding the callee's **parameter** tag (text) from
  the `is a number` predicate, which labelled an integer payload as
  text. Three changes: `emit_load_value_tag`'s no-tag arm now defaults
  to the integer tag unless `expr_leaves_tag_in_r11` confirms a tag was
  left there, which makes this class of mislabelling impossible
  whatever else is wrong; the parser now adopts a branch-nested
  `Return`'s declared type as the signature when the body declared no
  top-level one and every declaration agrees, which is the actual cause;
  and a function that falls off its end now returns its declared type's
  empty value (empty text, zero, or a `value` tagged as the number `0`)
  rather than whatever rax held, since a typed function could not
  previously reach that path at all. The same missing signature made the
  plain-type family silently wrong rather than unsafe — `Return a text`
  inside a branch printed the text's address as a number — and that is
  fixed by the same change. A function whose branches declare
  *different* types still has no signature to adopt and is unchanged
  (memory-safe, silently wrong); making that a compile error is a
  language decision, noted in the register. Regression test proven to
  segfault on the unfixed compiler and to pass after, with the
  single-expression `Return a value, <expr>.` form kept as the control.
  LANGUAGE.md's "One limitation to know" paragraph is rewritten: the
  factorial pattern now works for `value` returns. See
  [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #43.

- **`Seek ... to line N` reaches line N** ([#47](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — every
  target of 2 or more landed at the start of line 2, whatever N was, and a
  line past the end of the file never set the error flag. `_seek_fd_line`
  kept its line counter in `rcx` across the read syscall, and `syscall`
  clobbers rcx with the return address, so the counter became a code address
  on the very first byte read: the compare against the target failed
  immediately, the scan fell out at the first newline, and the past-EOF branch
  was unreachable. The counter now lives in `rbx`, which is callee-saved and
  already pushed. `Seek ... to byte N` was a bare `lseek` and was never
  affected; `_seek_fd_line` exists only in the x86_64 runtime. Found by the
  vox-fuzz files claim ledger (discrepancy D3) and adjudicated by the language
  lawyer.

- **A failed `Write` sets the error flag, and both read forms agree about a
  dead handle** ([#48](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — a `Write` to a full device, to a
  handle opened for reading, to a closed handle or to a handle whose `open`
  failed all succeeded silently as far as Vox could tell, so a write that did
  not happen was indistinguishable from one that did; and `Read from` a
  failed-open handle reported a zero-byte read where `Read line from` the
  identical handle set the flag. The three write macros issued their `write(2)`
  and popped straight past rax without inspecting it, and `FileWrite` never
  touched `_last_error` at all. Writes now record their syscall's outcome —
  the errno for a failure, `EIO` for a short write, zero on success — and
  `Write`, `Write a newline` and `Read from` set the flag on a dead handle
  exactly as `Read line from` already did. Found by the vox-fuzz files claim
  ledger (discrepancies D4 and D5) and adjudicated by the language lawyer.

### Changed

- **LANGUAGE.md defines buffer bounds** — writes accept positions 1..capacity
  and extend `size` (zero-filling any gap); reads accept 1..size; position
  0 is out of bounds for both. The compiler has always behaved this way and
  the manual's own worked example relied on it, but the Bounds Checking
  paragraph never said so (buffer ledger discrepancy D3). The fixed-buffer
  feature list no longer says truncation is "silent": it sets the error
  flag, as the Reading section already stated.

- **LANGUAGE.md no longer says `Read` appends** — the Reading section's
  high-level bullet claimed `Read` "appends incoming data to the buffer", as
  the explicit contrast against `Read line`'s "replaces". The compiler
  deliberately replaces (`codegen/statements.rs`: "read replaces, not
  appends"), `tests/runtime/b340_pipe_exact_fit.asm` asserts it, and no other
  sentence in the manual depends on append. The bullet now says `Read`
  replaces the buffer's contents and continues from the file's current
  position — which is the real contrast with `Read line` (files ledger
  discrepancy D2). The Seeking, Writing and Error Handling sections now also
  state that a failed `Write`, and a read on a handle whose open failed, set
  the error flag and are catchable.

- **LANGUAGE.md collections section: five examples corrected, one
  annotated** — from the vox-fuzz collections-a claim ledger
  (discrepancies D1-D6), each adjudicated by the language lawyer and each
  recompiled against this tree. The mixed-list widening example's `append
  hello to items` is now `append "hello" to items`: a bare word is an
  identifier (LANGUAGE.md:645-668), so the example as printed did not
  compile (D1). The list-of-maps paragraph no longer claims a `For each`
  "types the loop variable as a map" — the loop variable is deliberately
  untyped and map access is a static check, so reading a key off it is a
  compile error; the section now shows the index-loop idiom that works
  (D2). The mixed-list guard idiom is replaced for the same reason: a
  predicate reads the runtime tag but does not narrow the static type, so
  the guarded element has to be extracted into a declared variable (D3),
  and the `item as a number` cast the same paragraph offered as the
  alternative is dropped, since casting a dynamically-tagged value is a
  known gap and is rejected (D4). The promise that an unprovable value in
  a list "is always read back as what it is rather than silently
  reinterpreted" is hedged to match the limitation paragraph twenty lines
  below it, which always conceded the conservative `number` tag guess
  (D5). And the cyclic-list example's `(prints: [[...]] then cyclic)` is
  marked as the abbreviation it is — 64 brackets each side of the `...`
  (D6). Filed unfixed alongside these: [#44](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)
  (collections render as a raw address outside `Print`),
  [#45](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) (D5's compiler half) and
  [#46](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) (a diagnostic caret landing in a comment).

## [0.4.7] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **A float at or beyond 2^63 no longer saturates when printed**
  ([#34](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `Print`, `"{x}"` interpolation, and
  `x as text` all printed `9223372036854775808.372036854775808` for
  *every* value at or past 2^63 (10000000000000000000.0 included),
  because the formatter's integer part went through `cvttsd2si`, which
  saturates to `i64::MIN`'s bit pattern past `i64::MAX` — the trailing
  digits were the fractional part of that same wrong, constant value,
  which is why they never changed. The stored double was always
  correct; only the print path was wrong. 2^63 is already far past
  2^52, the point beyond which a double's 52-bit mantissa has no room
  left for a fractional bit, so every affected value is an exact
  integer — `_print_float` and `_buffer_append_float` now detect the
  magnitude and, for that range only, extract the raw mantissa and
  exponent and produce the exact decimal digits by schoolbook
  binary-to-decimal (double the mantissa's decimal digit string once
  per bit of exponent past 52), which is exact because no floating
  point is involved past reading the bits. Values below 2^63 are
  untouched and still use the original, already-correct path.
  Deliberately **not** fixed in this pass: a nonzero float below the
  formatter's fixed 15-digit fractional precision still prints `0.0` —
  a lost-precision problem in a different part of the same routine, not
  a saturation, tracked as still-open in the register entry. Regression
  test proven to fail on the unfixed compiler on exactly the
  large-magnitude rows, with the sub-2^63, division-derived, and
  IEEE-754-rounding rows kept as controls that pass on both sides. See
  [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #34.
- **`as a number` no longer wraps silently past i64's range**
  ([#35](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `"9223372036854775808" as a number` (one
  past `i64::MAX`) returned `-9223372036854775808` with the error flag
  never set, so `On error` could not catch it and the wrapped value was
  indistinguishable from a real one; applied to every base
  (`"ffffffffffffffffff" as a hex number` gave `-1`). Every digit in
  these inputs is valid for its base, so the documented "stops at the
  first invalid character" rule never engaged — the whole string parsed
  and the accumulator wrapped. `_parse_i64`, `_parse_int_radix`, and
  their length-bounded buffer variants in `coreasm/x86_64/int.asm` now
  accumulate the magnitude with an unsigned `mul` (which reports a
  truncated product instead of silently wrapping) and range-check the
  result against the sign at the end: a positive numeral must fit under
  `i64::MAX`, a negative one may reach `i64::MIN`'s magnitude (`2^63`) —
  the two are different bounds, so a naive "digits > i64::MAX" check
  would have wrongly flagged legitimate `i64::MIN` input, which is kept
  as a control. Either check failing sets the same error flag `On error`
  already reads for a wholly-invalid string. The returned value on
  overflow is not defined (0 or a wrapped magnitude); the flag is the
  fix. Regression test proven to fail on the unfixed compiler on exactly
  the three overflow cases, with `i64::MAX`, `i64::MIN`, a valid hex
  value, and the pre-existing `"abc" as a base5 number` raise kept as
  controls that pass unchanged on both sides. See
  [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #35.

- **A width specifier no longer changes what a value is**
  ([#36](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `"{f:06}"` on a float printed its raw
  IEEE-754 bit pattern (`4615063718147915776` for 3.5), and on a `text`
  printed the string's **address** — silent wrong data and an
  information leak, proven by two same-content texts printing different
  numbers. The type-aware dispatch in `emit_formatted_value` was gated
  on there being *no* width, so writing one skipped the type check
  precisely when the compiler knew the type best. Non-integer types are
  now rendered by type whether or not a width is present. The width is
  not yet *applied* to floats/texts — coreasm has padding primitives
  only for integers and hex — so a width there is ignored rather than
  honoured, matching the runtime-tagged `value` path; that cosmetic
  residue is recorded in the register. Regression test proven to fail
  on the unfixed compiler on exactly the float/text/buffer rows, with
  integer and boolean width rows kept as controls that pass on both
  sides. See [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #36.

- **A file's `readable` property now reflects its actual open mode**
  ([#37](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `readable` tested `fd >= 0`, which is
  true for any successfully opened handle, so a file opened `for
  writing` or `for appending` still reported `readable` as `1`. The
  obvious defensive idiom, `If f's readable then,` before a read, passed
  on a write-only handle and the read that followed failed at the OS
  level. `writable` already derived its answer correctly from the
  handle's recorded open mode; `readable` now shares that same source of
  truth instead of being a constant. Regression test opens one file for
  writing, appending, and reading in turn and checks `readable`,
  `writable`, and `permissions` in each mode; proven to fail on the
  unfixed compiler on exactly the writing/appending `readable` rows,
  with the `writable` rows and the constant `permissions` value kept as
  controls. See [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #37.

- **A format string in a collection prints as text at every position, not
  just the second** ([#39](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `["{base}", "plain"]`
  printed two raw pointers (a heap address that moved under ASLR between
  runs, plus a stable rodata address) instead of `core`/`plain`; moving the
  format string to the second slot made both elements print correctly,
  which was the tell that this was a static element-type inference bug,
  not a runtime-tag bug — a named list under a plain `print each` already
  worked, but attaching a `treating` clause to that *same* list broke it
  again. `Expr::FormatString` had no arm in the three places that classify
  a list's element type from its literal shape — the `for each`/`print
  each` inline-literal inference, the named-list-declaration inference
  that feeds `treating`, and `element N of <literal>` — so each fell
  through to its generic default (`Unknown`, which for a literal is not
  the same safe fallback `Unknown` is for a named list, since a named
  list's `Unknown` widens to `Mixed` and dispatches on the still-correct
  runtime tag, while a literal's `Unknown` fed nothing and defaulted to
  `PRINT_INT`). Bug #17 fixed this same missing arm in the two functions
  that back append and general expression typing; these three siblings
  were never given it. Fixed by adding `Expr::FormatString => VarType::
  String`/`Some(VarType::String)` to all three. Regression test covers all
  nine control rows (first vs. second position in an inline literal, a
  named list with and without `treating`, `element N of`, a plain `For
  each`, escaped-braces-only, and a no-format-string `treating` list);
  proven to fail on the unfixed compiler on exactly the format-first
  inline-literal, `For each`-over-literal, and named-list-with-`treating`
  rows, with the rest passing on both sides as controls. See
  [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #39.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **A period now closes a `Repeat` body** ([#27](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — the
  construct that `Repeat N times, <actions>.` is a sentence-ending loop, the
  shape LANGUAGE.md documents for `While` and `For each`, never closed on a
  period. The continuation was silently absorbed into the loop and re-run
  once per iteration, with no error: `Repeat 2 times, print "r". Print
  "after".` printed `r after r after` (the absorbed statement run inside
  the loop) instead of `r r after`. A second symptom shared the same root:
  a comma did not separate actions in a `Repeat` body, so `Repeat 2 times,
  print "a", print "b".` was a parse error at the comma — `Repeat`'s body
  loop was missing the entire separator handling that `While`'s had. Both
  are the same gap: the spec already promised that a period closes the
  innermost open clause and that `Repeat` is one such clause, so this is a
  fix, not a feature. `parse_repeat` now shares one body loop with
  `parse_while` (factored into `parse_loop_body` so the two cannot drift
  apart again): comma continues, period closes, blank line closes, EOF
  closes. `Repeat` was also added to `parse_block`'s self-terminating
  construct list alongside `If`/`While`/`For`, so a `Repeat` that is not the
  last action in a branch no longer swallows the action that follows it.
  Regression tests cover the period-closes case, the comma-continues case,
  the blank-line-closes case (the one path that already worked, kept as a
  guard), stacked periods closing a `Repeat` nested in each of `For each`,
  `While`, and `If`, a `Repeat` inside a function followed by a statement,
  a nested `If` as the last action, and the self-termination parity case.
  Parser-only; analyzer and codegen already handled a closed `Repeat`
  correctly. See [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #27.

- **A buffer declaration always allocates** ([#28](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — a
  `buffer` declared inside an `If` body that never ran, then redeclared at
  top level, segfaulted. The second declaration emitted no allocation at
  all — only `_buffer_clear` and `_buffer_append_bytes` — because the name
  was already bound, so the only `_alloc_buffer` sat inside the branch that
  did not run and the slot still held null when the clear dereferenced it.
  It needed both halves: neither a conditional declaration alone nor a
  redeclaration alone reproduced it, and only `buffer` was affected —
  `number` and `text` in the same shape were fine, as was the sized buffer
  path, which already allocated on every declaration. Diagnosed from the
  emitted assembly rather than from the symptom: the register's original
  guess (stack garbage dereferenced by `Print`) was wrong, since the crash
  happens even when the buffer is never read. The string-initialised
  declaration now allocates unconditionally, as the sized path always did,
  while preserving sizedness — an earlier attempt that allocated a dynamic
  auto-growing buffer everywhere silently disabled fixed-size overflow
  detection language-wide, which the full suite caught and the bug's own
  matrix did not. Twelve regression tests; eight segfault on the unfixed
  compiler and the rest are controls that must pass on both sides.
  See [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #28.

- **A string literal is data, never a name** ([#29](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md),
  [#30](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — two live defects from one design
  inconsistency, both cases of a string literal being resolved as a
  variable name when a variable happened to share its text. In a list
  literal (#29) the literal took its slot type tag from the colliding
  variable: colliding with a list gave a tag that led to a wild
  dereference and a segfault, and colliding with a number tagged a string
  pointer as an integer, so it printed as `4198536` — silent wrong data,
  the worse half. Colliding with a `text` was correct only by coincidence,
  the wrong tag and the right tag being the same number. In a buffer
  initialiser (#30), `a buffer called hello is "SURPRISE".` followed by
  `a buffer called b is "hello".` printed `SURPRISE`: no crash, no
  diagnostic, just the wrong contents. Both belong to #19's family, marked
  fixed in v0.4.4 — that fix removed the pattern from five codegen sites
  and missed these two. LANGUAGE.md's grammar is unambiguous that a string
  literal is data, so this is a fix, not a change of meaning. The cure is
  narrow at each site: `tags.rs` gains an `Expr::StringLit` arm returning
  `TAG_STRING` ahead of any lookup, leaving `Expr::Identifier` alone, and
  `buffers.rs` loses its `variable_types` lookup entirely, the code
  beneath it already appending the literal's bytes correctly. Eight
  regression tests covering every row of the matrix, controls included.
  See [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #29 and #30.

- **A `text` flag with no default reads as empty, not null**
  ([#31](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `a flag called name is "-n" or "--name",
  it is a text.` segfaulted the moment the flag was read and the user had
  not supplied it. A flag's slot was initialised to `0` whatever its
  declared type, which is right for a `number` or a `boolean` and is a
  null pointer for a `text`. A `text` flag with no explicit default now
  initialises to the empty string, so an unsupplied flag reads as `""` and
  can be tested with `is empty` the way the documented shape implies.
  See [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #31.

- **A flag keeps its declared type inside a function body**
  ([#32](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — a flag read inside a function was typed
  `boolean` whatever it had been declared as, so a `text` or `number` flag
  compared or interpolated inside a function produced wrong code. The
  analyzer held declared flags in a bare `HashSet<String>` — names, no
  types — and both type-query sites answered `Some(Type::Boolean)` for any
  name in the set. It misbehaved only inside a function body, because at
  top level the declaration's own type is still in scope and answers
  first, which is why the obvious one-line test passes and the defect
  could sit indefinitely. `flag_variables` is now a `HashMap<String,
  Type>`, populated from the declaration's `value_type`, and both query
  sites return the declared type. The regression test carries a top-level
  control alongside the function-body case to pin the diagnosis.
  See [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #32.

- **`is empty` on a `text` tests the contents, not the pointer**
  ([#33](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `"" is empty` was always false, for
  every `text` in the language. The predicate special-cased buffers and
  lists (read the length field) and fell back to `test rax, rax` for
  everything else; a text's value is a pointer to its NUL-terminated
  bytes, which is never null, so the predicate compiled to "is this
  pointer null". Found while verifying the documentation line #31's fix
  earned — the claim that an unsupplied text flag can be tested with
  `is empty` was written, then proven false before it shipped. The spec
  already promised the predicate on a text (its own worked example uses
  `if 'output file' is empty then,`), so this is a fix, not a feature.
  A text now tests its first byte, null-safely, at both twin codegen
  sites (expression and branch forms); both sites also stop resolving a
  string literal through `variable_types` — the #19/#29 family pattern,
  removed. Not one test in the suite used `is empty` before this bug's
  regression pair. See [docs/BUGS_FOUND.md](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md) #33.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **Loop expansion now honours its documented universality.** LANGUAGE.md
  promises that `each...from` is a *universal* loop expansion that "works
  with any action," yet an argument list holding more than one `each <name>
  from <collection>` clause — or an expansion mixed with a fixed argument —
  was a parse error at the `and`. That rejection was a gap in a promise the
  spec had already made, so this is a fix, not a new feature. A call's
  argument list may now hold any number of `each <name> from <collection>`
  clauses joined by `and`, and the action runs once per element of the
  Cartesian product, row-major — the leftmost clause is the outermost loop,
  exactly as if the clauses were nested `For each` loops. `'pair' of each x
  from [1, 2] and each y from [10, 20]` calls `'pair'` four times:
  `(1,10), (1,20), (2,10), (2,20)`. There is no clause cap; a fixed
  (non-`each`) argument may sit in any position; an inner collection may use
  an outer clause's variable (triangle iteration). Arity is still checked —
  a one-value action with two `each` clauses is a compile error, not a
  concatenation (`` `print` takes one value but this sentence supplies 2
  `each` clauses. ``), which is what keeps `print each x from A and each y
  from B` from being misread. Duplicate loop variables in one sentence are a
  compile error naming the variable; an empty collection in any position
  yields zero calls; `but if` attaches to the innermost iteration and may
  reference every loop variable; each loop variable retains its
  last-iteration value after the loop. The semantics is the Cartesian
  product (matching comprehension syntax in Haskell, Python, and Rust), not
  zip — `respectively` is left as a possible future zip marker. A pure
  extension: today's spellings of the form were all parse errors.
  Parser-only; the analyzer and codegen already handled nested `For each`
  loops. See
  [docs/plans/320_grid_expansion.md](docs/plans/320_grid_expansion.md).

## [0.4.4] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **The fuzzer's remaining findings, closed — the bug register is empty.**
  With 0.4.3's two segfaults, every bug vox-fuzz has reported is now
  fixed, and so is the sibling that fixing #24 uncovered.
  - **An integer literal too large for 64 bits compiled silently and
    evaluated to `0`** ([#22](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — a wrong answer with
    no crash, which is the failure mode this manual says the language
    exists to prevent. It is now a compile-time error naming both the
    literal and the valid range. `9223372036854775807` still compiles.
  - **Printing a list of `arguments's all` leaked raw pointers**
    ([#23](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) while `element N of` read the same
    values back correctly — the payloads were sound, their type tags
    were not. Same family as #17/#18, fixed the same way.
  - **Out-of-range positional properties segfaulted**
    ([#26](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) — `arguments's first` with no arguments,
    `arguments's second` with fewer than two, `environment's first` and
    `last` on an empty environment, and a negative index. Each handed a
    reader a null pointer to dereference. They now set the error flag
    and yield empty text, catchable by `On error`, matching `last`,
    `name`, `all`, `raw`, and `count`, which were already correct — the
    right behaviour had been implemented next door the whole time.
  - **A string literal in a function-body `If`/`While` condition
    resolved as a variable name** ([#21](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)) —
    `If w is not "banana"` failed with `Unknown variable: banana`. This
    one was a **regression**: an analyzer helper reintroduced the
    pre-0.3.0 quoted-token-as-identifier ambiguity that #19 removed from
    codegen, and it sat unreachable until an April cleanup widened a
    recursion guard and exposed it. The helper is deleted; a
    compile-fail test pins that genuine undeclared-identifier detection
    still works without it.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **Two segfaults, found by Vox's own fuzzer.** vox-fuzz — a fuzzer
  written in Vox — generated the programs that surfaced both, and both
  are now closed.
  - **A declaration on a conditional path read uninitialised storage**
    ([#25](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)). A name declared inside an `On error`,
    `While`, `for each`, or `Repeat` body registered in the enclosing
    scope, but its initialising store sat behind the branch — so when
    the branch never ran, the name read a raw stack slot: a `number`
    leaked a neighbouring frame's values (one program printed `12345`
    from an unrelated function, exit 0, no warning), and a `text` was a
    wild pointer that segfaulted. The compiler now emits the type's
    default at frame setup for any such name, so a declared name always
    holds its initializer or its type's default, exactly as this manual
    has always promised. Programs where the branch *does* run are
    unaffected.
  - **Reading an unset environment variable segfaulted**
    ([#24](docs/BUGS_FOUND.md)), and `On error` could not catch it,
    because the fault preceded any error-flag write. A missing variable
    now sets the error flag and yields empty text, like every other
    fallible read.
- **Two diagnostics that pointed at the wrong thing.** The orphaned
  `Return` error now carries a source location and explains that a
  body-level `Return` closed the function early; the cross-condition
  `Unknown variable` caret now lands on the failing read rather than on
  the declaration it was complaining about, with a hint naming the
  branch rule.

### Fixed

- **Nine more reserved words are now legal identifiers** — `capacity`,
  `raw`, `all`, `first`, `last`, `second`, `size`, `length`, and
  `version`. Each was reserved as a keyword but is only special in one
  fixed grammatical position, the same contextual-keyword treatment that
  freed `count` in 0.4.2. The compiler now lexes all nine as identifiers
  and claims each by lexeme at the position where it means something,
  leaving it an ordinary variable name everywhere else:

  - `capacity` — after a possessive marker (`data's capacity`) and in the
    `with capacity N` / `of capacity N` buffer-declaration phrase.
  - `raw` — after a possessive marker (`the program's raw`).
  - `all` — after a possessive marker (`the numbers's all`) and in the
    `all the numbers from/between … to and …` range literal.
  - `first`, `last`, `second` — after a possessive marker
    (`arguments's first`, `the letters's last`, `arguments's second`);
    `second` also names the `Wait 1 second.` time unit, so
    `Set second to 1. Wait second seconds.` waits one second while `a
    number called second is 0.` compiles.
  - `size` and its synonym `length` — after a possessive marker
    (`the letters's size`, `the letters's length`); `size` also in the
    `with size N` / `N bytes in size` declaration phrases.
  - `version` — the `Library <name> version "…"` and `see <lib>
    version "…"` header sentences only.

  Each is a bare variable name everywhere except its one fixed
  grammatical position; `arguments's first` and `a number called first is
  0.` both work in the same program. The quoted forms (`'first'`,
  `'size'`, etc.), which always lexed identically to the bare forms, are
  unaffected. The reserved alias `length` (previously an alternate
  spelling of `size` in the alias table) is now a contextual keyword — a
  synonym of `size` in the possessive dispatch only — so
  `a number called length is 1.` compiles and `x's length` still means the
  same as `x's size`. See [plan 315](docs/plans/315_contextual_keyword_family.md).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **Bare `count` is now a legal identifier.** It was reserved as a keyword
  alongside `capacity`, `length`, `first`, and `last`, but the word is only
  special after a possessive marker (`arguments's count`,
  `environment's count`) or in the `the argument count` / `the environment
  variable count` phrases. A word that is special in one syntactic position
  is no longer banned from every other, so `count` is now an ordinary
  variable name — declarations, `Set`, loop variables, function parameters,
  arithmetic, conditions — while every possessive `'s count` use is
  unchanged. The compiler now lexes `count` as an identifier and claims it
  for the possessive property in the parser, the same contextual-keyword
  treatment `start`/`begin`/`stop` already get for timers. The quoted form
  `'count'` (which always lexed identically to the bare form) is unaffected.
- **`cargo install vox-lang` produced a compiler that could not compile
  anything.** Cargo copies only the binary into `~/.cargo/bin`, leaving the
  crate's `coreasm/` behind in the registry cache, so every step of the
  resolution order missed and the first compile died with `unable to open
  include file 'coreasm/x86_64/core.asm'`. The crate already ships all 21
  `.asm` files — they are inside the crates.io tarball and covered by its
  checksum — so the compiler now carries them in the binary (a `build.rs`
  walks `coreasm/` at build time, so a newly added file ships without any
  list to update) and writes them to `~/.cache/vox/<version>/coreasm` the
  first time it needs them. The tree is written to a temporary directory
  and renamed into place, so it is never observably half-written and two
  vox processes racing on first use is harmless. Nothing is downloaded, at
  build time or run time. The embedded copy is consulted **last**, after
  `VOX_CORE_PATH`, the XDG config, the system paths, the executable-relative
  search, and `./coreasm` — so an RPM install, a development tree, and
  `VOX_CORE_PATH` all behave exactly as before. See
  [plan 312](docs/plans/312_cargo_install_coreasm.md).

### Added

- **Installing vox on dnf suggests vox-libs.** The RPM carries
  `Suggests: vox-libs` — a weak dependency, so nothing is pulled in
  automatically and the compiler stays standalone, but the relationship is
  recorded where packaging tools can see it. README and INSTALL.md now
  document the libraries and where they install.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- **Examples for everything 0.4.0 shipped.** `examples/delivery.vox` (user-
  defined things end to end) and `examples/supervisor.vox` (fork, non-
  blocking reap, deadline, Send signal, inline status decode) are new;
  `examples/pi.vox` adopts `times`; README's feature list catches up.
- **The compiler ships no libraries.** `lib/process.vox` moved out to
  [Vox-lang/vox-libs](https://github.com/Vox-lang/vox-libs). The reaped-
  status tests decode inline, proving the feature is complete with
  nothing installed. The shared-library machinery tests are unchanged.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-18

**Vox has a type system.** This is the biggest release in the language's
history: as of today, a Vox program can define its own types — in plain
English, like everything else here.

```vox
A thing called point has
  a function called 'placed at',
  a number called x is 0,
  a number called y is 0.

To do the point's 'placed at', with a number called across and a number called climb.
  a point called spot.
  Set spot's x to across.
  Set spot's y to climb.
  Return a point, spot.

The corner is a point's 'placed at' with 3 and 4.
Print corner.
```

That prints `{x: 3, y: 4}` — and yes, this example compiles; every
example in this release does, checked against the compiler before
shipping.

Things nest to any depth, copy by value, print themselves, compare
field-by-field, carry their own function members, and work across files —
all resolved at compile time, with not one byte of runtime added. The
generated binaries are still just your code and syscalls.

And because a memory-safe language should have to prove it: this release
was **adversarially tested before it shipped**. A red team attacked the
type system with 38 runnable probes; it found two real holes, both were
fixed, and the exact programs that broke the compiler are now regression
tests that must fail to break it. The copy semantics survived everything
thrown at them.

Also in this release: Vox grows real process control — `Send signal`
performs `kill(2)`, `reap ... without waiting` polls without blocking,
and `the reaped status` finally tells you *how* a child died. Decoding it
lives in `lib/process.vox`, **a library written in Vox, naturally** —
not a standard library, and not something the compiler needs: `the
reaped status` hands you the raw word and any program may decode it
itself. Vox has no standard library on purpose, and the compiler runs
perfectly with none installed. A pure-Vox process supervisor
(fork, poll, timeout, kill, classify) now needs no shell and no
coreutils. Timers were caught reporting a 100 ms wait as a full second
and now measure honestly, which matters rather a lot for the benchmarking
tool this unblocks. And `Print 6 times 7.` finally does what the manual
always claimed.

The full ledger:

### Added

- **User-defined things — composite value types declared in the program.**
  A new `thing` construct lets a program declare its own composite types at
  the top level, alongside the builtins. `A thing called point has a number
  called x is 0, a number called y is 0.` declares a type `point` with two
  number fields, each defaulted by a literal of its own type; the definition
  fixes a layout for the whole program and emits no code. A thing may also
  carry function members — `a function called 'placed at'` in the body
  declares the type's callable surface (its manifest), defined separately
  with `To do the point's 'placed at', with ...`. Declarations bring a thing
  into being with `a point called origin.` or `Create a point called p.`;
  `the` reads a known one. Fields are reached by possessive chains
  (`commute's leg's start's x`), and things nest (a segment holds two
  points) under an acyclicity check: a thing may name only previously-
  defined types, so a cycle is unconstructible within a file and is proved
  out across `see`d files by the analyzer's registry DFS. Things are
  values — assignment, argument passing, and return copy the whole thing
  field by field, so mutating a copy never touches the original. A member
  is called three ways: the free call `'magnitude squared' of origin`, the
  instance possessive `origin's 'magnitude squared'` (sugar that fills the
  first parameter with the receiver), and the type possessive `a point's
  'placed at' with 3 and 4` (a maker — the article `a` because a new thing
  comes into being). A manifest member must return its own thing; its first
  parameter may be the thing (reachable by instance sugar) or not (a maker,
  reached by naming the type). Things print as `{x: 5, y: 0}` and compare
  for equality field by field. Type, variable, and function names share one
  global identifier space (first-come-first-served); each type owns a
  separate member space. Cross-file, `see "./geometry.vox".` makes another
  file's things usable — a `see` of an unreadable file is now an error (it
  was silently skipped without `-v`), and a duplicate type name across a
  `see` now errors at the second definition, naming the other file. In v1
  a field's type is `number`, `float`, `boolean`, `time`, or any previously-
  defined thing (`text`/`list`/`map`/`buffer` deferred); user things are not
  part of the runtime tag system, so there is no `is a point` predicate, and
  a `.lib` cannot yet take or return a thing across its boundary (the
  diagnostic names the fields to pass across instead). Every reserved
  wrong-shape use has a targeted message — a thing copied from or written
  as a bare value, returned as a value, interpolated into text, or put in
  order; a member returning another thing, or declared but never defined;
  a maker reached by a receiver; a members-only or field-less definition;
  a definition written with `is` instead of `has`, created as a variable,
  defined inside a block, or defined after a variable of the same name; a
  field default of the wrong type; an unknown field type. `thing`, `has`,
  and `do` are contextual keywords — claimed only inside the construct,
  ordinary identifiers elsewhere, so `a number called thing is 5.` compiles.
  See the new [Things](LANGUAGE.md#things) chapter in LANGUAGE.md. Strictly
  additive: no existing program changes meaning; the construct, its
  diagnostics, the cross-file and `.lib` refusals, and the `see` behaviour
  tightenings are all new surface. Tests: `tests/330_thing_definition.vox`
  through `tests/340_thing_see.vox` plus `tests/include/geometry.vox`, and
  the `tests/compile_fail/thing_*.err` corpus.

- **`Send signal <N> to process <pid>.` performs `kill(2)`.** A new statement
  that sends signal `<N-expr>` to the process with PID `<pid-expr>` (syscall
  62). `child` is accepted as an alias for `process`, mirroring
  `reap process/child`: `Send signal 9 to child pid.`. On success it clears
  the error flag; on failure (`ESRCH`, `EINVAL`, `EPERM`) it sets it, so
  `On error` catches the failure exactly like the other syscall statements.
  Signal 0 is the standard no-deliver existence check, useful for probing the
  error path safely. Strictly additive: no existing program changes meaning.

- **`times` is now a multiplication operator, an alias for `multiply`.**
  `Print 6 times 7.` and `Set n to n times 10.` compile and behave exactly
  like their `multiply` forms, including precedence — `Print 2 plus 3 times
  4.` evaluates to 14, multiplication still binding tighter than addition,
  identical to `2 plus 3 multiply 4.`. `times` was already a reserved
  keyword for the `Repeat <count> times,` loop, so no lexer change was
  needed; the `Repeat` count is read with `parse_primary`, which never
  reaches the multiplicative layer, so the loop construct is unaffected.
  Strictly widening: no previously-valid program changes meaning.

- **`reap ... without waiting` performs a non-blocking `wait4(2)` (WNOHANG),
  and `the reaped status` yields the raw wait-status word.** Any reap form
  (`reap any child process`, `reap process <pid>`, `reap child <pid>`) takes
  a `without waiting` suffix, which calls `wait4` with `WNOHANG` instead of
  blocking. The return value is the whole value of the form: the reaped
  child's PID if one finished; `0` if children exist but none has finished
  yet (this is **not** an error — it is how "still running" is told from
  "gone"); or a negative value with the error flag set on a genuine error
  such as `ECHILD` (no such child), catchable with `On error`. A reap that
  returns `0` reaps nothing and does not disturb `the reaped status`.
  `the reaped status` is a new expression yielding the raw `int status` the
  kernel wrote, undecoded, from the most recent *successful* reap; before
  any reap it is `-1` (a sentinel kept in `.data`, not `.bss`, so a
  `--shared` library does not read `0` and misreport "exited cleanly"). The
  compiler contains no knowledge of the wait-status encoding. `without` is
  already a reserved keyword (the `print ... without newline` token), so
  the suffix cannot be confused with a call argument, and `reaped` /
  `waiting` remain ordinary identifiers everywhere they are not these
  forms. Strictly additive: no existing program changes meaning.

- **`lib/process.vox`, a library for decoding a wait status.** Ships in
  the repo as ordinary Vox and decodes the raw wait-status word with four
  functions matching the `<sys/wait.h>` macros: `'exit code of'` (bits
  8–15), `'signal of'` (the low 7 bits), `crashed` (true if a signal
  killed it), and `'exited normally'` (true if no signal was involved).
  Pulled in with `see "./lib/process.vox".`. Decoding lives here rather
  than in the compiler so that user-defined things (plan 310) can later
  wrap a status in a `process` thing with no compiler change.

  **This is a convenience library, not a standard library, and the
  compiler does not depend on it.** `the reaped status` is complete on
  its own — it returns the raw word, and any program may decode it with
  `divide`, `modulo`, and `bit-and` without `see`ing anything. Vox
  deliberately has no standard library: the compiler must build and run
  with an empty `/usr/share/vox/lib/`, and a language that assumed a
  package were installed would have a circular dependency it could never
  pay off. That directory is a *convention for users* — a place to drop
  your own libraries and reach them by bare name — not a compiler
  requirement. (An earlier draft of these notes called this file "the
  first standard-library file". That was wrong on both counts and is
  corrected here.)

### Fixed

- **Timer `duration`/`elapsed` reported the wrong time in every unit.**
  `... in milliseconds` read whole seconds × 1000, so a 30 ms wait read 0
  and a 1.5-second wait read 1000. The bare `the timer's duration` /
  `... elapsed` forms and `... in seconds` subtracted the monotonic
  clock's *calendar second fields* (`end_sec − start_sec`) instead of the
  real elapsed time, so a 100 ms wait that straddled a second boundary
  read 1 — a tenfold error — and a 1500 ms wait read 1 or 2 depending on
  where it began. `Start` and `Stop` already captured the nanosecond
  halves into `TIMER_START_MONO_NSEC` / `TIMER_END_MONO_NSEC`; nothing
  ever read them. A new internal `TIMER_ELAPSED_NANOSECONDS` helper now
  subtracts the full timespec with borrow handling (the shape
  `TIME_ELAPSED_PRECISE` already used), handles both the stored-end path
  (timer stopped) and the still-running path (sampling `clock_gettime`
  into a stack timespec and reading `[rsp + 8]` for nanoseconds), and
  leaves a 128-bit nanosecond total in `rdx:rax`. `TIMER_DURATION_SECONDS`
  and `TIMER_DURATION_MILLISECONDS` share that helper and differ only in
  the divisor (`NANOSECONDS_PER_SECOND` vs `NANOSECONDS_PER_MILLISECOND`),
  so seconds is now true truncation of the real elapsed time and
  milliseconds is true milliseconds. The meaning of the seconds/bare
  forms is unchanged — still whole truncated seconds, never milliseconds
  — but their values are now correct and no longer depend on where the
  interval fell within a second. This unblocks the planned Vox
  benchmarking tool, which is useless when a sub-second run reads zero.
  Regression tests: `tests/350_timer_subsecond_milliseconds.vox`,
  `tests/351_timer_millisecond_boundary.vox`,
  `tests/352_timer_seconds_still_whole.vox`,
  `tests/353_timer_elapsed_while_running.vox`,
  `tests/354_timer_bare_duration_whole_seconds.vox`.

- **A reserved word used as a loop variable reported "Missing loop
  variable" instead of naming the reserved word.** `print each arg from
  argv.` failed with "Missing loop variable after 'each'" even though
  the variable was not missing — it was `arg`, which the lexer folds
  onto `Token::Argument` (an alias of the reserved keyword `argument`).
  Because the parser saw a keyword token where it expected an
  identifier, it reported the variable as absent and sent the reader
  hunting for a syntax error that did not exist. Both each-loop variable
  sites (`each <var> from ...` and `for each <var> from ...`) now
  delegate to the existing `check_not_keyword` diagnostic when the token
  in the variable slot is a keyword, so the message names the spelling
  the user actually typed and notes that `arg` is an alternate spelling
  of `argument`. A genuinely omitted variable is still reported as
  "Missing loop variable": the loop's own `from`/`between` delimiters
  are excluded from the keyword check, so `print each from argv.` keeps
  its existing message. Diagnostics only — the program is still
  rejected, just with an accurate reason. No words were un-reserved and
  no loop semantics changed. Regression tests:
  `tests/compile_fail/087_reserved_word_each_loop_variable.vox`,
  `tests/compile_fail/088_reserved_word_for_each_loop_variable.vox`,
  `tests/compile_fail/089_missing_loop_variable_keyword_delim.vox`, and
  `tests/322_each_loop_reserved_word_regression.vox` (the renamed form
  still compiles and iterates).

## [0.3.7] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- **`begin`, `stop`, and `finish` are no longer reserved words.** They now
  behave exactly like `start` always did: the parser claims them for a timer
  statement only when a name operand follows (`Start the t.`, `stop t.`),
  and everywhere else they are ordinary identifiers — `a number called stop
  is 0.` now compiles instead of being rejected as a reserved keyword. The
  timer dispatch also gained that one-token lookahead for all four words, so
  a program can define and call its own zero-argument `start.`/`stop.`
  function; previously a bare `start.` was swallowed by the timer parser and
  died with "Expected timer name". Strictly widening: no previously-valid
  program changes meaning.

- **The compiler source is reorganised into focused modules.** Each
  compilation phase was a single very large `mod.rs` — codegen 11,061 lines,
  parser 7,224, analyzer 4,032, lexer 1,091 — which made the code hard to
  navigate, review, and contribute to. Every phase is now a directory of
  topical modules (for example `codegen/expr.rs`, `codegen/tags.rs`,
  `parser/control_flow.rs`, `analyzer/scope.rs`), with `mod.rs` reduced to
  the phase's type, shared constants, and module declarations: 494, 205, 200,
  and 52 lines respectively. This is **pure code motion — no behaviour
  change**. Every step was verified by compiling the whole example and test
  corpus and confirming the emitted assembly stayed byte-identical to the
  pre-refactor compiler's, alongside the full test suite. Nothing about the
  language, the CLI, or any public interface changes; the difference is
  purely that the source is now navigable.

### Fixed

- **Appending a format string to a list stored a corrupt element** (BUGS_FOUND
  #17). `append "fmt {x}" to out.` — and a `text` local initialized from a
  format string and appended by name — wrote the element's runtime type tag
  as plain integer instead of text, because neither the pre-scan nor the
  emit-time tag selector recognised `Expr::FormatString` as always producing
  text. Reading the corrupted element (whole-list print, `element N of`, or
  `for each`) then reinterpreted a valid string pointer as an integer:
  sometimes a raw pointer address printed in place of the text, sometimes a
  crash, depending on what surrounding code did with the misread value. Fixed
  by teaching both the pre-scan (`prescan_expr_tag`) and the emit-time
  fallback (`infer_expr_type`) that a format string is always `text`.
  Regression tests: `tests/bugs_found_17_format_append_text.vox`,
  `tests/bugs_found_17_format_append_number.vox`,
  `tests/bugs_found_17_format_append_buffer.vox`,
  `tests/bugs_found_17_format_append_named.vox`,
  `tests/bugs_found_17_element_access.vox`, `tests/bugs_found_17_for_each.vox`,
  plus three codegen unit tests pinning the tag write and the no-spurious-
  widening behaviour.

- **The `.lib` table of contents under-reported list element types for
  provably-`text` elements** (BUGS_FOUND #18). A `--shared` build's element-
  type scan credited only a direct literal or a parameter's declared type,
  so a `text` local's declared type, a called function's declared `text`
  return, and a format-string append (once #17 made the element itself
  sound) all shipped as plain `list` instead of `list of text`, even though
  the runtime tagger already agreed on `text` and consumers already printed
  correctly. The scan now credits all three. A genuinely mixed or
  evidence-free list is unaffected — still plain `list`. Regression tests:
  `plan_303_local_declared_type_credits_element_parameter`,
  `plan_303_call_declared_return_type_credits_element_parameter`,
  `plan_303_format_string_credits_element_parameter`,
  `plan_303_newly_credited_shapes_in_return_position`,
  `plan_303_function_call_return_type_scoped_per_library`,
  `plan_303_local_declared_type_conflict_stays_unknown`.

- **A string literal's content was silently resolved against known variable
  (or top-level constant) names at codegen time** (BUGS_FOUND #19). The
  crash form: `a text called x is "x".` reads `x`'s own not-yet-written slot
  instead of the literal (its declared type is registered before its
  initializer is generated), segfaulting on first use. The much wider,
  silent form: `a text called greeting is "hello". a text called b is
  "greeting". Print b.` printed `hello`, not `greeting` — any literal whose
  text coincides with any in-scope variable's name, in an initializer or a
  bare `Print "literal".`, silently took that variable's value instead, and
  a literal matching a `float`/`buffer` variable's name could flip an `is a`
  type predicate or an equality comparison's codegen strategy. Every
  `Expr::StringLit` codegen site now treats its payload as text
  unconditionally, with no variable-table or constant-table lookup on its
  content — matching LANGUAGE.md's post-0.3.0 rule that a double-quoted
  token is data everywhere, never a name. Identifier-based resolution (bare
  and single-quoted names, map lookups, `{name}` format-string
  interpolation) is unchanged. Regression tests:
  `tests/bugs_found_19_self_name_initializer.vox`,
  `tests/bugs_found_19_other_name_initializer.vox`,
  `tests/bugs_found_19_other_name_print_direct.vox`,
  `tests/bugs_found_19_predicate.vox`.

- **Comparing a `text`/`buffer`/string literal to a `number`, `float`,
  `boolean`, `list`, or `map` for equality dereferenced the non-stringy
  operand as a string pointer** (BUGS_FOUND #20). `If "abc" is equal to 3.5
  then, ...` segfaulted with no variable or name collision involved at all;
  `list`/`map` operands didn't crash but gave a wrong answer via a suspected
  out-of-bounds read. Pre-existing, but the #19 fix made it commonly
  reachable: a literal that happens to share a variable's name (e.g. `"pi"
  is equal to pi`) previously took a different, wrong-but-non-crashing path
  by accident, and now correctly reaches this one. Comparing a stringy
  operand against a *provably* non-stringy one now folds to a compile-time
  constant (`is equal to` → false, `is not equal to` → true) without
  evaluating either operand; `text`/`buffer` comparisons, and comparisons
  involving a dynamic `value` operand, are unaffected. Regression tests:
  `tests/bugs_found_20_no_collision.vox`, `tests/bugs_found_20_float_collision.vox`,
  `tests/bugs_found_20_number_boolean_list.vox`, `tests/bugs_found_20_not_equal.vox`,
  `tests/bugs_found_20_buffer_text_positive.vox`, `tests/bugs_found_20_return_position.vox`.

- **`End` is no longer documented as a timer-stop spelling.** It never
  worked: `end` lexes into the `exit` keyword family, so `End the t.` was a
  parse error despite LANGUAGE.md listing it beside `Stop`/`Finish`. The
  spelling list now matches the compiler.

### Documentation

- **Documented how to close more than one level of nesting.** A period closes
  one open clause and a blank line closes every open clause, but nothing
  described the space between them: periods stack, so N periods close N
  levels. This is also how an author chooses which `if` an `Otherwise` or
  `But if` continues — an else-chain continues the innermost `if` still open,
  so closing that `if` first hands the branch to the enclosing one, a
  one-character difference in the source. Undocumented, this was easy to get
  wrong in a way that produces no error: too few periods and following
  statements are absorbed into a clause the author believed was closed, and
  if one of them is a loop's increment the program hangs silently. LANGUAGE.md
  gains a *Closing more than one level* section with worked examples at one,
  two and three periods, the equivalent empty `Otherwise,.` form, and
  `tests/nested_clause_close_levels.vox` pins the behaviour. No compiler
  change: the parser was correct throughout.

- **A "Projects built with Vox" section in the README.** Lists actively
  developed FOSS projects written in Vox, with an invitation to add yours by
  emailing vox-lang@tegosec.com.

- **A design document and implementation plan for the module split**
  (`docs/MODULE_SPLIT_DESIGN.md`, `docs/plans/306_module_split.md`), recording
  the strategy and the procedure the refactor below followed.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **`but if` is now a general conditional branch.** Both the default action
  and each branch action may be any valid statement, in the plain form and in
  loop expansion — previously only `print` (and, outside loop expansion,
  `append`) could carry a `but if`, and anything else was rejected with
  "'but if' conditional branching only works with print statements". A branch
  body is parsed with the ordinary statement parser rather than a
  per-statement-kind grammar, so new statement kinds gain `but if` support
  automatically. The terse `append <value>` form, which inherits its target
  from the base statement, still works, and a branch naming a different list
  or buffer than the base is still a compile error.

- **In-place retyping for `value` variables.** The statement
  `<valuevar> is a <type>.` converts a `value` variable in place and updates
  its runtime tag. Supported targets are `number`, `float`/`decimal`, `text`,
  and `boolean`; the conversion follows the same rules as the static cast
  table. The same phrase in condition position (`If v is a number then, ...`)
  remains a type predicate. A failed runtime conversion sets `_last_error` and
  leaves the variable holding `0` so `On error` can catch it; retyping a
  statically-typed variable is a compile error with a remedy pointing at the
  explicit cast.

- **A warning when a function is still open at end of file.** A function body
  is closed by a blank line, so without one the rest of the file is read as
  part of the body and the program silently does nothing. The compiler now
  points at the function definition instead of compiling a do-nothing binary
  in silence. Suppressed for `Library` files and `--shared` builds, where a
  trailing function ending at EOF is correct by construction. This is a
  diagnostic only — the parsing behaviour is unchanged.

- **A `type` property on every variable.** `<var>'s type` returns a text
  description of the variable's declared type, e.g. `Number (static)` for a
  `number` or `Text (dynamic)` for a `value`. Statically-typed variables fold
  to a compile-time literal; `value` variables dispatch on the runtime tag
  already kept in their shadow slot or BSS mirror. Intended for debugging and
  logging — type tests still use the `is a <type>` predicate.

### Fixed

- **Seven compiler bugs found while building a JSON library**, all with
  regression tests:
  - A `float` interpolated into a `text`/`buffer` destination
    (`a text called t is "{y}".`) printed the raw IEEE-754 bit pattern
    instead of the number.
  - `buffer as text` returned the buffer's struct pointer rather than its
    character data, so the cast silently produced an empty string.
  - Extracting a `float` from a `value` by reassignment (`the y is v.` /
    `Set y to v.`) produced the raw bit pattern; only declaration with an
    initializer worked. A `value` source no longer overwrites the
    destination's declared type.
  - Extracting a `list` from a `value` produced a bogus pointer and a length
    of `-1`, while the same extraction into a `float` or `map` worked.
  - **Assignments to a top-level variable inside a function did not persist,
    and could read another function's local.** Top-level `number`, `float`,
    `text`, `boolean`, `buffer`, and `value` variables now live in one storage
    location shared by top-level code and every function, so a write inside a
    function is visible after it returns. Previously such a write allocated
    an uninitialised per-call stack slot, so a counter could read an
    unrelated function's local instead of its own value. For `value`
    specifically, its runtime type tag is stored alongside the payload in its
    own shared location too, kept paired with it on every read and write, so
    the value keeps behaving as the type it currently holds — not just an
    integer that happens to round-trip. Declaring a variable of the same name
    inside a function still shadows the global, and recursion still gets
    per-call locals.
  - A map key taken from `map's keys` never matched on lookup, always
    returning the not-found sentinel, even though the key printed correctly.
  - Chaining an index over a property read (`element 1 of m's values`)
    produced garbage; the same read split across two statements was correct.

- **A `but if` chain was closed by a period belonging to a nested clause, so
  every later branch was silently lost.** A period closes only the innermost
  open clause, but a `but if` branch consumed one that belonged to a clause
  *inside* it — most visibly an `On error` handler attached to a fallible
  action in the branch. A dispatch loop giving each branch its own failure
  handling ran only its first branch, with no error; the same structure
  without `On error` produced a misattributed `Unknown variable` error
  pointing at an unrelated, valid line. A branch body is now parsed as a
  block, like an `If` branch, so it can hold its own trailing clause, and a
  period followed by `but` continues the chain instead of ending it. A period
  that genuinely ends the chain still ends it.

- **Reassigning a `value` that held a `float` to an integer left the static
  type stale at `float`.** The runtime tag was written correctly, but declaring
  `a value called v is 3.5.` let the initializer's type-inference demote the
  `value` from its `Mixed` (runtime-tagged) type to a concrete `Float`, so
  every later read dispatched on the stale static type instead of the tag:
  `Print v` emitted `PRINT_FLOAT` and reinterpreted the integer `1` as the
  denormal `0.0`, and `If v is a number` folded statically to false. A declared
  `value` now keeps `Mixed` through its initializer — the same guard the
  bare-assignment arm already had — so reads dispatch on the runtime tag as
  intended. Covers all three assignment spellings (`Set v to`, `the v is`,
  `v is`) and a function reassigning a top-level `value` global.

- **A declared-but-uninitialized `text` variable held a null pointer, so
  printing, interpolating, or comparing it segfaulted the process on the
  first read** (`a text called ex.` / `Create a text called ex.`, then
  `Print ex.`). Every other default-initializing type had a real, safe
  default; `text` fell through to a generic zero-fill that later reads
  dereferenced. An uninitialized `text` now points at a real, shared empty
  string, so it reads, prints, and interpolates as `""` and can be
  reassigned normally afterward.

- **`Create a TYPE called NAME.` (and the bare `a TYPE called NAME.` form
  with no initializer) now default-initializes every declarable type
  uniformly**, routed through one shared type resolver instead of a
  hardcoded subset. Previously only `number`, `text`, `boolean`, and
  `buffer` default-initialized this way; `float`, `list`, `map`, `value`,
  and `timer` now do too. `file` and `time` still require an explicit
  initializer — a default value would be meaningless for either (no path
  to open, no timestamp to hold) — and are rejected at compile time with a
  message naming what to supply.
  - An uninitialized `value` now defaults to `nothing`, not the number `0`.
  - An empty `map` now prints `{}`, not `{`.

### Changed

- **A reserved-word error now names the word you wrote.** Declaring a
  variable called `length` reported that `'size'` was reserved, because the
  lexer canonicalises the alias before the check runs. It now reads
  "Cannot use 'length' as a variable name" and explains that `length` is an
  alternate spelling of `size`. `length`/`size` is also documented in the
  reserved-alias table.
- **An unmatched `{` in a string literal has a real diagnostic.** It
  previously failed with an empty-named `Unknown variable: `; it now names
  the unmatched brace and points at `{{` / `}}` as the literal-brace escape.
- **LANGUAGE.md's blank-line rule corrected.** It claimed a blank line after
  a function definition was "a style convention, not a requirement". A blank
  line is in fact the only thing that closes a function body.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **Nine compiler bugs found while building a JSON library**, all with
  regression tests:
  - `Print` on an inlined float-returning call no longer prints the raw
    bit-pattern.
  - `Return a boolean, A and B.` now parses and evaluates correctly even
    inside an `If` branch.
  - A nested, self-terminated `If ... .` no longer closes the outer statement
    early (both `If` branches and `While` bodies).
  - A function call in an arithmetic expression now binds tighter than the
    surrounding operator instead of absorbing it as an argument.
  - Same-named locals in different functions no longer corrupt each other's
    list/element-type inference.
  - Reading an element (or iterating with `For each`) from a bare `list`
    parameter now preserves the per-slot runtime type tag.
  - `{{` and `}}` in string literals now collapse to literal `{` and `}`.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **A `but if` branch on a non-`print` action (e.g. `append`) could silently
  discard the rest of the program.** The branch's grammar didn't consume a
  trailing `to <name>` clause, which desynced the parser into treating
  everything after it as the body of a bogus, never-called function. This
  was a regression: the previous release rejected the same source with a
  compile error instead of silently discarding it. It's a compile error
  again if the branch names the wrong target, and consumed correctly
  otherwise.

- **A function could only declare a handful of parameter and return types.**
  `number`, `float`, `text`, `boolean`, `list`, `map`, `buffer`, `file`,
  `time`, `timer`, and `value` now all work identically as a parameter type
  and a declared return type, for ordinary functions and for shared-library
  (`.lib`) functions alike. Previously only five of these were accepted as a
  return type at all, and `float`/`time`/`timer` weren't accepted anywhere.

- **A list returned or passed across a `.lib` boundary printed raw memory
  addresses instead of its actual contents.** The list's length and
  structure always crossed correctly; only its element type was lost. The
  compiler now infers a list's element type from the exporting function's
  own code and carries it across the boundary automatically, for every call
  shape - no new syntax required.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **Reassigning a variable to a value of a different type could silently
  produce a wrong number, or segfault** — the compiler's tracked type for a
  variable could disagree with what the variable actually held at runtime,
  and formatting/printing code trusted the tracked type. Depending on the
  direction of the mismatch this either printed a pointer address as if it
  were a number, or dereferenced a raw number as if it were a string
  pointer and crashed:

  ```
  a number called n is 5.
  n is "abc".
  Print "{n}".        -> printed a garbage number; could also segfault
                          depending on which way the mismatch ran
  ```

  A variable's type is now fixed at its declaration and never changes. A
  write that would change it — `n is "abc".`, `the n is "abc".`, or `Set n
  to "abc".`, and reusing an already-declared name as a loop variable, an
  `open ... called` target, or an `Allocate ... for` target — is now a
  compile error instead:

  ```
  n is "abc".   -> error: cannot assign text to 'n', which is a number
                    help: convert it explicitly:  n is "abc" as a number.
  ```

  **If a program you have relies on this**, convert the value explicitly
  with `as a number` / `as text` / `as a float` / `as a boolean` at the
  point of assignment — this syntax already existed and is unchanged. A
  variable declared `a value called x` is unaffected and keeps accepting
  any type, as documented.

  This also closes several related cases with the same root cause:
  incrementing or decrementing a text variable, a declaration inside an
  untaken `If`/`Otherwise`/`While`/`Repeat`/`for` branch or an `on error`
  handler that never fires, a nested declaration that reuses an outer
  variable's name with a different type, and reading a mismatched value out
  of a map whose value type is provable from its own literal.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **A function call inside an explicit `{...}` group failed to parse when the
  enclosing statement had reserved `of` or `to` for itself** — most visibly,
  `byte {<call>} of <buffer>` and `element {<call>} of <list>` rejected any
  function call in the braces, even a single-argument one, so a program had
  to precompute the index into a local variable first instead of writing it
  directly.

  ```
  byte {ci of 1 and 2} of b     -> error: Expected a statement, got And
  ```

  The connector-precedence fix in 0.3.0 reserved `of`/`to` for the duration
  of parsing an index or bound, so an identifier immediately followed by that
  word couldn't swallow the enclosing statement's own connector. But the
  reservation wasn't cleared when parsing entered an explicit `{...}` group —
  even though the closing brace already unambiguously ends the group, leaving
  nothing left to protect. It now correctly parses:

  ```
  byte {ci of 1 and 2} of b     -- compiles and evaluates correctly
  ```

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **A `.lib`'s declared return type silently dropped to void** for any
  function whose `Return` was not its first statement — the common case for
  any function with real logic before returning. `Return`'s type is parsed by
  two different code paths depending on where it sits in the function body;
  only one of them fed the parsed type back into the function's declared
  return type. A library's own interface file could describe a function as
  returning nothing when it genuinely returned a value.

  ```
  To gb with a number called x.
    a number called y is x add x.
    Return a number, y.
  ```

  Before this fix, the emitted `.lib` read `To gb with a number called x.` —
  no `, returning a number` clause. It now correctly reads `To gb with a
  number called x, returning a number.`

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-07

`"..."` is now always a string literal — never an identifier. Names are bare
words (`total`), or `'single quoted'` when they contain spaces
(`'total items'`). This closes the single overload that has caused this
project's worst defects: `a number called "x" is "get five".` used to
silently parse a function call as a string and print a stray pointer instead
of calling anything. The "Names and strings" section of `LANGUAGE.md` is the
full guide.

> **Breaking.** Every existing `.vox` program that names anything the old way
> (`a number called "x" is 5.`, `To "greet".`, `print "greet" of 3.`,
> `Library "lib" version "1.0".`) now fails to compile, with a diagnostic
> telling you the correct replacement. There is no compatibility window.
>
> | Before | After |
> |---|---|
> | `a number called "x" is 5.` | `a number called x is 5.` |

### Fixed

- **A function call could silently misparse as a string literal**, printing a
  raw pointer instead of calling anything — `a number called x is "get
  five".` compiled and ran, printing something like `4198480`. The old
  grammar (`name ::= string | identifier`) made this possible in any position
  a name was expected; it no longer exists.
- **The same defect shape, independently, in `element N of`.** `element 1 of
  "no such thing".` compiled and printed `0` — a string naming nothing was
  silently treated as an out-of-bounds access rather than rejected. Bare
  string literals are now rejected in this position with a clear diagnostic.
- **A value-typed parameter's runtime type tag could leak across function
  definitions.** If two functions in the same file reused a parameter name
  (e.g. both taking a parameter called `x`), a later string literal that
  happened to equal that name could be misread as a stale value tag instead
  of literal data. `variable_types`/`mixed_tag_slots` are now scoped per
  function, matching how ordinary variables already were.
- **A `.lib`'s declared return type was silently dropped to void** for any
  function whose `Return` was not its first statement — the common case for
  any function with real logic before returning. The library's own interface
  file described a function as returning nothing when it returned a value.
- **`to`/`of`/`with` as universal call connectors collided with grammar that
  already used those words** — `Set x to 1.` followed later by `x` used as a
  range bound, `append ... to`, and `element N of`/`byte N of` with a
  variable index could all misparse as function calls, consuming a token that
  belonged to the enclosing statement.

### Added

- **`docs/check-samples.sh`** — extracts every runnable code sample from
  `LANGUAGE.md`, compiles it against the built compiler, and reports honest
  pass/fail/skip counts with an internal consistency check (`checked +
  skipped` must equal the real number of samples). Every sample in the
  language reference is now verified to actually compile, not merely
  asserted to.
- **A C-interoperability test** confirming a Vox `--shared` library is
  genuinely callable from C: a built `.so` has zero `NEEDED` entries
  (freestanding), exports the documented mangled symbol names, and a C driver
  linked against it produces the exact expected output.
- **`tools/migrate-identifiers`** — the mechanical migration tool described
  above, with its own test suite (idempotent, byte-identical on
  already-canonical input, preserves the semantic meaning of blank lines
  between function definitions).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-03

A Vox program can now call a Vox library. Build a library with `--shared`,
then consume it from another Vox program with
`see "<lib>" version "<ver>" from "<path>.lib".`. The "Shared libraries"
section of `LANGUAGE.md` is the full guide.

> **Breaking.** This release breaks three things a non-Vox consumer, a
> `--shared` build, or a stale `see` can depend on. Each is detailed under
> `### Removed` and `### Changed` below; the summary:
>
> 1. **Every exported library symbol is renamed** to `<lib>_<version>_<func>`
>    (e.g. `add_two_numbers` → `mathkit_1_0_add_two_numbers`), with no
>    unmangled alias. Any C/Rust/assembly consumer must update its `extern`
>    declarations and relink.
> 2. **`--shared` now requires a `Library` declaration.** Add
>    `Library "name" version "x.y".` at the top of the library source.
> 3. **Three `see` forms that silently linked nothing are now compile
>    errors.** Switch to `see "<lib>" version "<ver>" from "<path>.lib"`.
>
> Upgrading from before 0.1.23? Two earlier breaking changes are documented
> under their own releases below: arithmetic on a text/buffer/list/file now
> errors with a cast suggestion (`0.1.21`), and `.en` source includes no
> longer inline — use `.vox` (`0.1.23`).

### Removed

- **Three `see` forms that silently linked nothing are now compile errors.**
  `see "./path.so".`, `see "lib" version "1.0" from "./path.so".`, and
  `see "./path.so" for "lib" version "1.0".` previously compiled while linking
  nothing — every call into the library was simply missing, with no warning.
  They now error and name the canonical form
  `see "<lib>" version "<ver>" from "<path>.lib".` (the `see ... for ...` form
  has its own diagnostic). A previously *silent* failure is now loud — that is
  the point of the change, not a regression. If a build breaks here, build the
  library with `--shared` (which writes the `.lib` beside the `.so`) and point
  `see` at the `.lib`.

### Changed

- **Every exported library symbol is renamed.** Labels are now
  `<library>_<version>_<function>` — for example `add_two_numbers` becomes
  `mathkit_1_0_add_two_numbers`, and `greet` becomes `mathkit_1_0_greet`.
  There is deliberately **no unmangled alias**: an alias would let two versions
  of one library collide in the same `.so`, which is exactly what the scheme
  exists to prevent.

  If you call a Vox library from C, Rust, or assembly, update your `extern`
  declarations and relink:

  ```nasm
  ; before
  extern add_two_numbers
  extern greet
  ; after
  extern mathkit_1_0_add_two_numbers
  extern mathkit_1_0_greet
  ```

  Find the new names for any library you have with:

  ```bash
  $ nm -D --defined-only libmathkit.so
  00000000000005c4 T mathkit_1_0_add_two_numbers
  00000000000005f9 T mathkit_1_0_greet
  ```

- **`--shared` now requires a `Library` declaration.** A `--shared` build
  with no `Library` line has no identity to mangle with and no `.lib` to emit,
  and now errors:

  ```
  error: A shared library must declare its identity with a `Library`
  declaration giving its name and version — without one there is no mangling
  and no `.lib`. Add `Library "name" version "x.y".` before the function
  definitions and rebuild with --shared.
  ```

  Add `Library "name" version "x.y".` at the top of the library source.

### Added

- **Consuming a library from Vox.** `see "<lib>" version "<ver>" from
  "<path>.lib".` resolves the `.lib`, selects the block matching name *and*
  version, verifies every promised symbol against the `.so`'s dynamic symbol
  table (a stale `.lib` is a compile error, not a runtime crash), registers
  the signatures so calls type-check, and links the `.so` with an `-rpath`.

  ```vox
  see "mathkit" version "1.0" from "./libmathkit.lib".

  a number called "sum" is "add two numbers" of 3 and 4.
  Print the sum.
  ```

- **The `.lib` interface file.** A `--shared` build writes `<output>.lib`
  beside the `.so` — the library's name and version, the `Location` of its
  `.so`, and a table of contents of every exported function's signature. It is
  the only place Vox types live; a `.so` carries mangled names but no types.

  ```
  Library "mathkit" version "1.0".
  Location "./libmathkit.so".

  Table of Contents:
      To "add two numbers" with a number called "a" and a number called "b", returning a number.
      To "greet".
  ```

- **Several libraries — and several versions of one library — in one `.so`.**
  `vox a.vox b.vox --shared -o lib.so` links multiple libraries in a single
  link step (you cannot append to a linked `.so`). Two versions of the same
  library coexist with distinct mangled symbols, so a consumer can keep
  calling `mathkit_1_0_add_two_numbers` after `mathkit_2_0_add_two_numbers`
  ships beside it, with no recompile. Duplicate `<library, version>` pairs
  across inputs are rejected; multi-input is `--shared` only.

- **Consumption diagnostics.** Each failure mode is its own error naming the
  file and what was expected: a missing `.lib`; no such library in it (with the
  libraries it does declare); a version mismatch (listing the versions
  offered); a missing `.so` at `Location`; a stale `.lib` promising a symbol
  the `.so` does not export (naming the mangled symbol); and an arity or type
  mismatch at the call site (naming the library and version).

## [0.1.24] - 2026-08-03

Compiler fixes. No breaking changes.

### Fixed

- **`append each x from <list> to <dest>`** no longer has its destination
  eaten by range parsing. A list source `[1, 2, 3]` now appends `[1, 2, 3]`,
  while the range form `append each n from 1 to 5 to rl` still appends
  `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- **`append <expression> to <list>`** now parses its value with full
  arithmetic. Appending a computed value in a loop works — `append i multiply i
  to squares` across `i` from 1 to 5 now yields `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`.
- **A timer's `start time` and `end time`** now parse through the reserved
  `time` keyword, so `Print the "job timer"'s start time.` and `... end time.`
  work as documented and return unix timestamps.

### Changed

- **`VOX_CORE_PATH` is the documented environment variable** and
  **`~/.config/vox/config` the documented config path.** The older
  `EC_CORE_PATH` and `~/.config/ec/config` still work as deprecated aliases:
  the `vox` name wins when both are set, and a one-line deprecation note is
  printed (on stderr, at the start of the build) when only the old name is
  found. Existing shell profiles and CI that set the old name keep working;
  migrate when convenient. Note that the note on stderr can surface in builds
  that capture stderr and expect it empty.

## [0.1.23] - 2026-07-31

Collections, maps, the `nothing` value, and the shared-library foundation.

> **Breaking.** `.vox` is now the sole source extension: a `see` of a `.en`
> source, which was the only include form that worked before, no longer
> inlines (silently — the call site errors "Unknown function"). Switch `.en`
> includes to `.vox`. The main input still accepts any extension. See
> `### Changed` below.

### Added

- **Whole-list printing.** `Print <list>` renders the list (`[1, 2, 3]`), and
  `{list}` format interpolation routes the same way. Previously printing a
  list showed only the first element.
- **Mixed-type lists with per-slot type tags.** A list may hold number, text,
  decimal, and boolean together; each element carries a one-byte runtime tag
  and reads back as its own type. A list the compiler can prove homogeneous
  keeps an untagged fast path; one it cannot prove widens to mixed by default
  ("static is a proof, mixed is the default"), so an opaque value — e.g. a
  function result with no declared return type — is never silently reinterpreted.
- **Nested lists.** A list element may be a list; printing is recursive and
  cycle-safe (capped at depth 64).
- **Type predicates.** `is a number/text/decimal/boolean/list/map` (and
  `is not a …`) read the runtime type tag and fold at compile time on a
  statically-typed value.
- **The `value` type.** A declared dynamic type that carries its runtime tag
  across a function call, so one function can accept "whatever this slot
  holds" and ask `is a …` inside. A `value` is rejected from arithmetic until
  its type is checked.
- **`nothing` (the absent value).** `null` and `nil` are accepted spellings.
  It sits in a list, map, or `value` slot, prints as `nothing`, and is tested
  with `is nothing`. It is not `0`: `0 is nothing` is false.
- **Maps.** Key/value collections — JSON objects. `{"key": value}` literals
  (empty `{}`), `map's "key"` read, `set map's "key" to value`, `length`/
  `empty`/`keys`/`values`, recursive printing. A missing key sets the error
  flag (it is an error, not `nothing`); keys are text only.
- **Shared-library foundation.** `--shared` builds a self-contained,
  position-independent `.so` a C or assembly caller can reach; only the
  library's own functions are exported (runtime symbols are kept out of the
  dynamic table), and an empty `--shared` export is rejected. (Consuming a
  library from Vox via `see` of a `.lib` arrives in 0.2.0.)

### Changed

- **`.vox` is the sole source extension.** `see` of a `.vox` source now
  inlines correctly — the include gate previously matched `.en`, so
  `see "./foo.vox".` was silently skipped and the call site errored "Unknown
  function". The `.en` form, which was the one that worked, no longer inlines;
  switch `.en` includes to `.vox`. The main input still accepts any extension.
- **`nothing` is refused in arithmetic.** A literal `nothing` in arithmetic
  is a compile error — "Cannot use nothing in arithmetic; check it with 'is
  nothing' first" — and a `nothing` that turns up at run time (read from a map
  or a mixed list) sets the error flag so `on error` catches it. `nothing` is
  new in 0.1.23, so this is a safe default, not a change to code that used to
  work: there was no `nothing` to put in arithmetic before.

### Fixed

- **Maps own their keys.** The map copies each key on insert rather than
  borrowing the caller's text. No current Vox program could break the old
  borrowing — keys are text literals and buffers are rejected as keys — but a
  dynamic key would have corrupted the entry; a forward correctness fix.

## [0.1.22] - 2026-07-31

A hardening release with one user-visible fix.

### Fixed

- **Function-parameter type labels no longer leak to the top level.** A
  parameter named like a top-level variable previously relabeled it: after
  `To "show" with a text called "x"`, top-level arithmetic on a number `x`
  was falsely rejected as text arithmetic. The parameter's type is now
  scoped to its function body.

## [0.1.21] - 2026-07-28

Heterogeneous lists, type-checked arithmetic, and buffer-safety fixes.

> **Breaking.** Arithmetic on a text, buffer, list, file, or timer now
> errors with a cast suggestion. Such code previously compiled to pointer or
> handle arithmetic and produced a wrong number at runtime. Add a cast where
> you meant a numeric conversion. See `### Changed` below.

### Added

- **Heterogeneous lists with per-slot type tags.** A list may hold mixed
  types (number, text, decimal, boolean); each element carries a runtime type
  tag and reads back as its own type. (Whole-list printing, the `value` type,
  type predicates, maps, and `nothing` follow in 0.1.23.)

### Changed

- **Arithmetic operands are type-checked.** Using a non-numeric value — a
  text, buffer, list, file, or timer — in arithmetic is now a compile error
  naming the value and suggesting a cast (`as a number` / `as a float`).
  Previously such code compiled to pointer or handle arithmetic and produced
  garbage at runtime. Add a cast where you meant a numeric conversion.

### Fixed

- **A genuine fixed-buffer overflow is an error**, not silent data loss.
