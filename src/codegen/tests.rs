    // a failure to scope the SIGNATURE tables (`function_return_types` /
    // `function_param_types`) by <lib,version>. With identical signatures, a
    // collapsed (name-keyed) table produces byte-identical codegen to a scoped
    // one — the second library's return type "wins" but is the same value, so
    // nothing observable changes. A test that passes for the wrong reason
